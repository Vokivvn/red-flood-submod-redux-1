#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_DURRUTI_DESC:0 "José Buenaventura Durruti Dumange has been influenced by anarchism since his youth. Like his father, he worked as a mechanic in his hometown of León, and like his father he also joined the Unión General de Trabajadores. Durruti saw with his very eyes the brutal repression that proletarians were subjected to by the wealthy, evolving to more radical views for which he was expelled from the Unión soon after. \n\nFollowing these events, he came into contact with the Confederación National del Trabajo, a then blooming organization of anarcho-syndicalists. Related to the terrorist group Los Solidarios, he was forced to flee to Latin America after the police drew links between their organization and several bombings and bank robberies across the country. In Argentina and later Chile he would continue his life as an outlaw, committing the first bank robbery in the history of the latter country. Durruti returned to Spain after the proclamation of the Second Republic and quickly aligned himself with the Federación Anarquista Ibérica sector of the movement, who opposed cooperation with the Republic and insisted in the need to maintain a constant struggle with authority through terrorism. \n\nInternal tensions came to a breaking point, and the faction who advocated an understanding with a united leftist block left the CNT forever. The FAI-CNT, as it became known from then on, would slowly discover itself to be completely enchanted by Durruti's charisma and legend. Durruti has unknowingly crystalized a personality cult around himself that has ironically been useful to advance the anarchist cause, side-lining his opponents and solidifying his authority over the militias. "
POLITICS_GUILLEN_DESC:0 "Abraham Guillén Sanz has become one of the most quoted and influential theorists within the FAI-CNT, and for a good reason. His superb research on economics and guerrilla warfare helped the Revolution immensely, as he shaped the disorganized volunteer militias into a feared fighting force ready to strike at any moment. Guillén didn't limit his work to intellectualism, and he also fought as a foot soldier and later became a full-time political commissar. \n\nHis theories, however, are at times viewed with scepticism at best and suspicion at worst by many members of the movement. Guillén has clamoured time and time again for a system alien to the Malaparte-influenced status quo. Mixing Proudhonian mutualism with his own theories on so-called anarcho-marxism, he advocates for a bottom-up stateless republic. Free of the slavery of German bureaucracy and of capitalist tyranny alike, this new Federal Republic, would promote free trade and competition among localized unions. These unions would, in turn, be represented along regional and national councils. \n\nA genuine believer in Pan-Iberian nationalism and proudly sporting an idiosyncratic ideology, the brilliant theorist has become the face of the CNT, taking advantage of the chaos and uncertainty that the FAI dominance caused. Now at the very top of Iberia itself, Abraham Guillén might prove to be the renovator, or the assassin, of anarchism."
POLITICS_PESTANA_DESC:0 "Ángel Pestaña Núñez was, like his comrade Durruti, a native of León. Born into a poor family and orphaned at a very young age, Pestaña toured Spain and France for years as a migrant worker before settling in Algeria. There he saw the start of the Great War, and decided to dedicate himself fully to anarchism, writing for the CNT-FAI weekly Tierra y Libertad. \n\nIn 1923 he would gain great relevance and respect within the movement, as he was the confederate envoy to travel to Berlin and draw up a report on the situation. His document was decisive in marking the irreversible break between anarchism and communism in Spain, as the CNT would choose not to collaborate with movements within the International. However, Pestaña is by no means a radical. He was the head of the faction most predisposed to collaborate with other movements and take legal routes as frequently as possible, which led him to confront the faista faction that still advocated the continuation of terrorism and secrecy during the Republic. Pestaña, disappointed, split from the already renamed FAI-CNT and founded his own platform, dubbed the Partido Sindicalista. \n\nPestaña, now again relevant after the Spanish Revolution, has a chance to reach the top thanks to a great coalition of "pariahs" of anarchism that has materialized around him. This alliance is, however, weak, and the diplomatic anarchist turned General Secretary must know how to maneuver in a delicate situation that might prove fatal for Iberia and for the very ideal of anarchism itself."
