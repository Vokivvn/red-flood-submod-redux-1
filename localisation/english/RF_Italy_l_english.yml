ITALIAN_EMPIRE_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Italy is probably the greatest victor of the Great War, but its gains have carried heavy costs. The empire is vastly overextended, the economy is grinding to a halt, and for 20 years the military has stagnated. Despite this, the strength of the ruling United Democratic Party of Italy has made it the sole bastion of European liberalism. How long can it last?"

#EVENTS
italy.1.t:0 "A Crisis of Conscience"
italy.1.d:0 "Ivanoe Bonomi, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Italy and informal leader of the left wing of the United Democratic Party, gazed out at the crowds milling through the Piazza del Popolo. He took a long sip of his espresso and quickly flicked his eyes over the newspaper in front of him. Lots of political editorials this week, mainly concerning the upcoming handover of power to Sturzo and the right wing of the party. As he read, he felt himself growing increasingly agitated, but without any clear reason. What was wrong with him today?\n\nHe began to understand as he walked back to the Palazzo Chigi. It was that word, the one word that had brought so many Italians to accept and even endorse almost 15 years of PDIU rule.\n\n"Democratic".\n\nSince the beginning, the trust he had shared with Giolitti and Sturzo had hinged upon that word. It was the word that had brought so many millions of Italians to the voting booths to vote for their new party. It was the word that had also fueled the meteoric rise of the Partito Radicale, split the Partito Socialista irrevocably, and strangled the Partito Popolare in the cradle. Now this word, this idea, began to itch and eventually to tear at the conscience of the man to whom it was so dear.\n\nWas this really what he had hoped for? The PDIU was created as a united front against extremist aggression, but it had accumulated so many of the worst flaws of a liberal party. Corruption, cronyism, cynical manipulation-- this was becoming the PDIU's bread and butter. Worst of all though, by taking up the mantle of Italian democracy in the widest way possible. It had become a party of political monopoly, the only safe choice for the Italian people in a world turning away from freedom.\n\nSettling into a chair at his office, he removed his private diary from a locked drawer.  After much soul-searching, he took up his favorite pen and wrote the following:"
italy.1.a:0 "Whatever happens, we must all make sacrifices for the safety of Italian democracy."
italy.1.b:0 "As far as democracy goes, we must not surrender that which is most important."

italy.2.t:0 "PDIU wins the 1936 elections"
italy.2.d:0 "In an event which has surprised essentially no one, the PDIU  has won the 1936 Italian General Election, resulting in Luigi Sturzo taking control of the party from Ivanoe Bonomi. Celebrations in the streets of Italy have been noticeable, but mild. It is after all, hardly a significant nudge of the status-quo. However, the Italian nation and the Italian people are always happy to be reminded that they are one of the last bastions of freedom within a twisted world of Despots, Futurists and Communists following the deathly trials of the Great War. \n\nThe coalition party that is the Partito Democratico Italiano Unito was formed not long after the end of the Great War in response to rising activities from the radical Right and Left, such as the Blackshirts championed by Benito Mussolini as well as Communist militias. A unified big-tent, democratic bloc can easily be said to have saved Italy from the dangers of radicals and extremists. A state of affairs which the Italian people have been very comfortable with to say the least. \n\nThe monopoly of the PDIU has been for many years without competition due to the big-tent nature of the party. It is after all, hard for radicals or opposition members to take charge when moderate factions are united. PDIU's hegemony was shaken a little with the death of Giovanni Giolloti in 1928, who was the undisputed hegemon of Italian politics. Away from the public eye, corruption slowly grows within the party and the messy response to the Slump has not been kind to the governing bodies of Italy either. No matter the case, the popular will of the Italian people, even if they do not have all the facts in front of them, has been made clear and it certainly seems that PDIU is here to stay."
italy.2.a:0 "Italy lives!"

italy.3.t:0 "Transformato"
italy.3.d:0 "Following the announcement of the results of the 1936 Italian General election, there has been ecstatic celebration from more liberal and conservative government officials in the PDIU. Although the victory was hardly a surprise as essentially everyone had predicted a victory for the PDIU, but a shift to power no matter how expected is always welcome. As a result, Sturzo held a speech in Rome earlier today, addressing a modestly sized crowd of his plans for Italy to escape the slump so that "Italy may be reborn as the star of Europe, burning as bright as the sun!" Curiously Bonomi was notably absent from the podiums around the area where the speech was held, even though other members of the leftist factions of the PDIU were also present. Whatever the reason behind the disappearance of Bonomi, the speech was still well received and it is clear that the people of Italy have a bright future waiting for them."
italy.3.a:0 "Cheers to the Sturzo!"

italy.4.t:0 "Bonomi's Speech"
italy.4.d:0 "Bonomi stood facing the parliament. Making this speech was a tough decision to make, but he believes it is necessary not only to clear his conscience, but to potentially save Italy from becoming yet another tyrannical regime. He took a deep breath, and began speaking:\n\n\"Ever since the end of the Risorgimento and the dawn of the 20th Century. The Italian nation has been the defining nation of the world. Not necessarily in our actions in a global sense, but certainly in our policies. The end of Great War, saw Europe falling into the clutches of radicals: reactionaries, socialists and accelerationists, but not us! We stand here today as a beacon of freedom and democracy, or at least so we thought...\n\nMy friends, for a party that calls itself democratic, the practices within it are disrespectful or even insulting to the term \"democracy\". For twelve years, this party hasn't lost a single election, not just because of our fervent opposition to radicals from left and right, but because of the wide range of people it appeals to. This party brings together political factions that would oppose each other if we were in let's say United Kingdom, or Sweden, or any other still functioning democracy. And with each victorious election comes the transformato, the prime ministers switch allegience between Sinistra and Destra back and forth so that each faction has majority when their turn comes.\n\nMany of you refuse to see this, but Italy has become a one-party state for the mere sake of anti-extremism. What has this achieved? It has only allowed for corruption and cronyism to grow. These reprehensible things are rife within the party, many among you are only interested in satisfying your insatiable thirst for power. How can there be someone looking at the hands of the ruling and safeguarding the interests of the minority in a country with no real opposition?\n\nBecause of these reasons, my friends, I declare that PDIU-Sinistra shall participate in the elections in earnest. We will no longer continue this power sharing arrangement.\"\n\nFollowing this speech, the entire Italian parliament was in an uproar. At first, more conservative members of the PDIU denounced Bonomi. Even some people on the left shouted him down. Eventually, the outrage spread across parliament, even the most cool headed individuals started shouting and heckling their peers. Some defended Bonomi, many others criticised him. What the full ramifications of this event will be, it is too early to tell, but it is certain that the situation does not look good for the PDIU."
italy.4.a:0 "It doesn't look good for any of us."

italy.5.t:0 "Collapse of the Coalition"
italy.5.d:0 "Chaos has erupted throughout every part of Italy today following Ivanoe Bonomi's speech in parliament where he outed the PDIU as undemocratic and corrupt. Many believe that was merely a pretext to refuse to cede power to Sturzo. The immediate result of the speech was what anyone would have expected it to be. Shouting matches quickly started, with members of PDIU-Destra denouncing and demonising Bonomi, framing his actions as a betrayal of the PDIU and the italian democracy. Though a few hardline members of the left faction of the PDIU along with parties outside of the coalition have supported Bonomi's decision with varying motives and varying intensity.\n\nNot long after the speech, the party began to descend into utter chaos with many of its members declaring their departure from the coalition. Perhaps most notably, Luigi Sturzo himself has defected to Lista Nazionale. A controversial move, given that the party was founded by and composed of many former Fascists, most notably Italo Balbo. Similar defections have occured all across the PDIU as the party came crashing down like a house of cards. The more left-leaning members of PDIU have followed suit, with some joining the liberal Partito Radicale Italiano and others becoming part of the social democratic party.\n\nFor the first time since in more than a decade, political violence has erupted across the Italian nation. There have been reports of protests if not riots across the country. Street fights have become increasingly common with there even being reports of deaths resulting from clashes between political groups in hotspots of political extremism. Most notably in the city of Milan, where a gunfight that broke out resulted in the deaths of 10 people.  Anarchist and Syndicalist forces have also exploited the situation, organising strikes and marches across the country to make the most of a situation ripe with opportunity for spreading support for leftist movements.\n\nWith such radical changes swiftly taking hold of the Italian nation uncertainty is spreading, and many look on in fear at what the future may bring."
italy.5.a:0 "The time has come to decide our fate..."

italy.6.t:0 "1936 elections"
italy.6.d:0 "Only a few days ago, the future for Italy did not seem to be much different than the years of relative stability and prosperity that Italy had seen under the leadership of the PDIU. The monopoly of power held by the PDIU seemed so unshakeable that some had remarked that the PDIU could never be overthrown, describing it as the "Leviathan" of Italian politics. And ironically, this statement was proven to be true. Indeed no outside force would have been capable of overthrowing the PDIU. Only the PDIU itself could manage such a thing, and following Bonomi's decision to contest the election results and block Sturzo from gaining control of the PDIU, that is exactly what it did.\n\nThe PDIU exploded from the resulting political chaos, many of its members joined other (generally more radical) parties. An additional consequence has been that many previously minor parties have seized the moment to gain popularity among the Italian population, some parading and demonstrating for their cause, others launching campaigns to boost support. The most notable of these parties are Partito Radicale Italiano led by Francesco Nitti and  Lista Nazionale, to which Luigi Sturzo has defected to. \n\nFrancesco Saverio Nitti, the old stalwart of radical liberalism, has seen growing popularity for his pledges to proactively fix the economy by subsidizing individual farmers, centralizing the land sales, reforming currency and expanding the banking sector. PRI supports a wide range of social and economic reforms including improvement of the welfare system, industrializing italian territories in Africa and expanded rights for women. Perhaps the most ambitious plan is to crack down on the corruption festering in Italy and thus, help bring about a prosperous Italian south, on par with the economic giants that are cities like Milan, Florence or Rome. Moreover, Francesco also aims at regimenting the armed forces by developing the industrial complex, pulling the army round and coordinating all branches of italian military. \n\nLuigi Sturzo on the other hand, still has support from former Conservatives who had been radicalised by the destruction of the PDIU, as well as some single issue voters who tend to be composed of the more religious members of society. Sturzo claims to have reinvented his policies which now include plans to implement a socialized economy with strong emphasis on traditional catholic values. Lista Nazionale has also highlighted their aim to brutally crack down on what has been dubbed "The Three Plagues" Separatism, Corruption and Illegalism. The LN has also promised to rebuild the Italian economy and utilise the riches of the colonial empire to elevate Italy to new heights. \n\nThe fact that this election is essentially the first contested election in Italian politics in many decades has led to massive amounts of political polarisation within the country. As the Italian nation stands at a fork in the road, it's people can only wait and see what the future holds."
italy.6.a:0 "Francesco Saverio Nitti and the PRI win the elections."
italy.6.b:0 "Luigi Sturzo carries LN to victory."

italy.7.t:0 "1936 Economic Report"
italy.7.d:0 "A report coming out of our Economic Development Department is making the rounds within our government due to its shocking results. While it is no surprise the economic depression is continuing, the amount of damage it has caused was less well-anticipated. Deflation from the collapse of both small banks and Credito Italiano combined with our over-reliance on imports from Austria and the Balkans in the face of our struggling industrial sector has caused prices to fall by 8%. Furthermore, private imports of capital goods increasing our farming production combined with the fall in demand has resulted in farmers overproducing their goods causing an increase in poverty amongst out farmers. The report concludes that over the past year unemployment has increased by about 10% and GDP has not risen at all and if anything has fallen by more than a percent.

He was deeply against a compromise with the desert tribes, but Rome had spoken very clearly: a long and bloody guerrilla war would benefit neither the Italians nor the Sanusi. Peace was worth a try, or so they said. So much time, so many resources, so much blood, all wasted. Yet he had to follow orders. He let out a groan and proceeded to carefully read the draft Rome sent. He was not a diplomatic man, but Graziani was not completely sure some vague promises of autonomy for the Libyans would be enough to convince the so-called Matari of Mnifa to simply lie down his arms and peacefully surrender. He carefully paced his office, looking out the window that directly faced the indomitable arid wasteland beyond the Green Mountain. Somewhere out there, a secret army of hundreds of thousands patiently waited for him to make a mistake. They would tear him and his army piece by piece like rabid dogs at any chance they may get, and the Governor doubted a simple bone would be enough to keep these beasts satiated."

He carefully tied his officer's sabre around his waist and put on his military cap, looking at himself in the mirror. This meeting deserved some ceremony and reflection. The Matari had been a great adversary and had fought valiantly. For years, they had duelled swiftly and masterfully, manoeuvring each other into ambushes and traps using perfectly calculated tactics. Mukhtar had made him double-guess himself at every turn, move carefully and plan every single movement. And now Graziani had won. Yet, he felt empty. It was barely a surrender. There was no great battle, no final face-off, no honour in this peace. As he stepped out of the ruined manor he had been using as base of operations, he finally saw him. His figure, with clothes and beard as white as marble, was mesmerizing, carrying himself with humility and dignity. Mukhtar stepped down from his purebred horse, and without moving his gaze away from the Italian's eyes, extended a firm hand. Graziani and the Lion shook hands.\n"You have been a valiant enemy."\n"War is war," the sheikh answered stoically."

They exchanged jokes about such a pitiful petition, a good sign for the Libyan resistance. On top of a small wooden platform, the old teacher himself gestured for the tattle to quiet down and rose from his seat to speak to the crowd. The warriors quickly silenced themselves and each other to listen to the Lion.\n"We have fought proudly and honourably, and this is what we have to show for it," Mukhtar proclaimed, holding the letter for all to see, "but this is not victory. It is, however, a proof that we are slowly bleeding them out. We must still fight, until the very last drop of blood. We are the men of the hills and the desert, brave as lions. Even the men of the cities have forsaken us, and thus we must not forget we are alone in this war. We achieve martyrdom or glory. I advise you to prepare for the many battles to come. May Allah protect you."\nDespite Omar al-Mukhtar's calm and mellow voice, the Libyans erupted into loud and chaotic cheers for their old chieftain, then dispersed along the duar to prepare their weapons, their morale in an all-time high. Italian blood would sluice the mountains and valleys just as much as Senusi blood."

The formed Italian delegation was not delighted with its assignment, despite the importance of its task. France has been in a state of post-war confusion for several years now, shaking from constant coups, but who knows, maybe the current government will show miracles of pliability? On the other hand, what will happen if French will reject the offer?... However, the meeting is scheduled at the Vieille Charité - a luxurious almshouse, which is located in the equally beautiful Marseille. It's unlikely that the French would choose such a wonderful place if they just wanted to refuse the offer, right? The ambassadors reached the meeting place by sea, leaving Livorno. The good sunny weather brightened up the trip, and many delegates had a, perhaps even naive, confidence of success. However, world was torn apart by Grande Guerra. The world in which there is little to be truly sure of... \nArrived in Vieille Charité, the officials didn't recognized the place. Judging by old photographs and paintings, it definitely looked different before. Back in a day, it looked definitely better. The delegation was met by people in theatrical masks. The French clearly want to impress their guests! Heading to the entrance to the building, the diplomats were greeted by an alley of grotesque and eerie sculptures: some of them took bizarre, alien forms, which replace clear angularity with arbitrary curves; some were scenes of torture and murder, including those involving animals. Some of the ambassadors joked about the strange taste and desire of the locals to shock the guests. Entering the spacious hall of the almshouse, a group of Frenchmen was sitting at a large table and discussing something loudly and laughing, at first ignoring those who entered. The diplomats themselves did not immediately realize that they would have to communicate with this eccentric group. The attendants seated the ambassadors in their places at the table, but away from the receiving party. The head of the delegation, after a short mutual greeting, outlined the purpose of his visit and began to convince the French of the need to legally consolidate the guarantees of peace between two states.From the hitherto the smile on the faces of the French, shining with joy, disappeared. After a short conversation with each other, which was accompanied by smirks in the direction of those who came, one of them, a stocky Frenchman with a piercing gaze, stood up and burst into a tirade: \n\"If you are really asking us what you talked about ... then we are discouraged. By Le Patron, is THIS you want from us?! This is awkward! You know, we're the people of art, we are driven by emotions, feelings that, being a projection of Le Patron, tells us - agreements with democratic pigs are just wasting our time! Don't you understand the futility of your efforts? Don't you understand that your system of values will soon cease to exist?! We are futurists, we are the POWER that changes the world! Your society is stuck in the past and it is our duty to sooner or later crush you like insects, leaving no trace of you! Now go home, close your doors and gag on pasta tirelessly, knowing that someday we will come for your wives and raze you to the ground!\" \nThe Frenchman's face turned red with tension, he sat down and began to catch his breath, while the faces of those who until recently naively believed in the success of the meeting, froze in horror. Another Frenchman, in a cold voice, recommended leaving immediately, giving the ambassadors five minutes. Three of which have already passed, he said."

Almost as if Sturzo was betrayed yet again in such a short period of time. But there was nothing else he could do, so he began speaking: \n\n\"Dear citizens... Recently, our country has been hit by a wave of social and economic upheavals, and the democratic government has done everything in its power to resolve the situation. Unfortunately, this effort by the previous cabinet wasn't enough. And it has been decided, that in order to resolve the current circumstances, the title of prime minister shall be transfered to someone who we believe has just the right approach to solving existing problems. I hope with all my heart that with a responsible person like Italo Balbo, it'll be possible to save our country in these difficult times. God save Italy.\" \n\nAfter his speech, Sturzo withdrew. In his place came Italo Balbo, who made a fiery speech in which he declared that as the sole leader of Italians, he will from now on do everything so that Italy becomes more powerful than ever before.

He was pragmatic, shrewd, and played his cards close to his chest —a man after his own heart. Though those shared qualities would not help the throngs of journalists that followed the two men — God knows what wild speculations would be printed in tomorrow morning's newspapers. Perhaps his Holiness might have some guesses, given his connections to the realm above. \n\nBalbo had chosen to walk the last section on his way to the Palazzo San Callisto. Dressed simply in a well-tailored suit, his only sign of ostentation a pair of exquisite Florentine loafers, he breezed through the streets of Rome, his spirit as light as a feather. One could be forgiven for thinking he was heading to a restaurant with friends, rather than to meet with the most influential man on the planet. Though as soon as the doors of the palace closed behind him, he knew hours of difficult discussion lay ahead. Certainly a lighter burden than those carried by the prime ministers of the last century, though; Sturzo had made sure of that back in 1920. \n\nAnd that lighter burden showed on the faces of Balbo and his Holiness after the conclusion of their secretive talks — smiles and niceties all around. If only all of his political contemporaries could be so accommodating."

In 45 minutes, the Marshal was finally able to see it.\nIt was an extensive complex, covering perhaps a couple of acres counting both the building itself and the outdoor plaza and recreation area. The building itself was rather simple and plain, built by architects that favored sustainability and efficiency rather than beauty. As soon as his chauffeur stopped the car in front of the plaza and he walked out of the car and into the plaza, Badogilo was greeted by the staff of this building, who then ushered him into the structure. The staff gave him a brief tour of the building, designating him where everything was at: the kitchen, washrooms and bathing centers, the sleeping quarters, everything to ensure that one could live in relative comfort here.\nOnce the tour ended, the staff finally guided him to one final room: a large room with a panel roof. In the room were numerous desks and tables, most covered in large boxes containing a forest's worth of paper and files, others were covered in maps of various areas of the world and had small figures dotted on them. The only clear table was in the center, one that would be used for meetings.\nAround said table stood the finest military minds Italy could offer, Badoglio included. They were all here due to a single order by Ill Duce Balbo: To devise new and infallible warplans that are to be used in Italy's future wars of conquest and bring glory to the peninsula and the government that rules it.\nThere was a pregnant silence in the air for a few moments, then Marshal De Bono spoke up."

Ashtrays and half-drunk bottles of alcohol were scattered across the room and a rancid combination of sweat, cigarette ash, coffee grounds,and stale liquor have long since created a foul odor that has spread across the complex. Marshals Messe and Graziani would get into an argument about the ideal formation for a particular combat situation, but both were too tired to go to any length beyond that and the argument ended with both of them opening new bottles of scotch.

He wore a decorated military uniform, showing him to be a respected and influential member of Italy's armed forces, but Balbo had difficulty recognizing him at first.

They didn't bother to burn it-- it wasn't like anybody else but Italians were going to attack Corsica at this point. They snuck into the city of Ajaccio. Their targets were the city hall, telephone exchange, harbor buildings, and police station. Splitting into their teams, they stole through the night as quiet as mice.\n\nUntil they hit their targets. At all four locations spotlights flared on as they approached, and machine gun fire tore through the Italian special forces teams. Men who had trained for months for this died in seconds, their effort utterly wasted. Sergeant Bernardi suppressed a scream. How the hell did they know? One of the damn generals must have sold out, miserable traitors! \n\nBefore he knew it, he was the last man left in his team.

"Well captain, that task force is going to be followed by a huge French garrison and reoccupation unit. We could try to defend the city, but we'd just get shelled to pieces. We're going to split into platoons, disperse and live off the land, link up with the paratroops if possible. It's in the hands of the higher-ups now-- are they going to send a relief force and seize the island before France can mobilize, or pretend we did this all on our own and maybe shoot a few generals for 'high treason' rather than start a war?"\n\nGreco nodded.

Operation Quartenion is a complete and absolute success! Britain has no way to react! Italia has established its complete hegemony over the entire Mediterrean! We've surpassed all odds and we've managed to achieve an historic victory that will stay in the history books for ages and ages!

Our new state of Peace with Great Britain is a stable one, as both sides have agreed to keep the territories they've managed to hold on to during the conflict.\n\nWhile going to war with the United Kingdom because of Operation Quartenion wasn't in our intentions and despite the very high costs of our war with Albion, we still have to celebrate the important military achievement that is going toe to toe with the Royal Navy and coming out relatively unscathed.\n\nWhile some pessimistic might have the gall to describe Quartenion as a partial delusion or even as a complete defeat, we still need to keep our heads raised high to live and fight another day to uphold Italy at the world stage as the great power it needs to be forevermore."

That little surprise they did together with Fiume two years ago must not go unpunished!\nAfter that, we can afford to take a walk to Yugoslavia. Having completed the operation in the east, we can confidently say that the Adriatic finally has become our mare nostrum.\nSeparately, I would ask you to make plans in case Germany and Spain, in case of unwillingness to agree with our course of European domination, want to attack us.

Now he straightened his coat as he prepared to explain for the first time the details of his platform to the Italian people.\n\n"My fellow citizens-- today I am proud to say that the government of this kingdom has approved my 15 point plan to secure the future of the country. I realize that the details have been left a bit vague, and I apologize: let me run through some of the points now. \n\nFirst, we must have civil peace and order. This is the first duty of every government. Therefore we will promote measures to bring about peace both here in Italy proper and in our overseas territories. After that, we can begin an aggressive plan of economic revitalization, starting with agriculture and finance. Using that as a foundation we can then fight unemployment through expansion of public works and the armaments sector, while fighting poverty through welfare reform, and finally bringing the South up to parity with the North. Once the mainland is dealt with, unemployment will be further reduced by significant military and civil projects in our overseas territories, capping things off with comprehensive military and administrative reforms overall. We will stop at nothing to bring the peoples of Italy to a future of liberty and prosperity!" \n\nAs he left, journalists began to pepper the Prime Minister with questions about particulars-- all except one, anyhow. He counted on his fingers again; 10, 11, 12. Thirteen if he really stretched it. Maybe he was missing something, but he was sure that Nitti had only revealed 12 of his 15 points today. He shrugged."

As he walked out of the Gialo safe zone, his heart began to beat frantically to the growing danger all around him. A lone, young Italian man walking into the desert armed with nothing but khaki shorts and an Arabic phrasebook? God only knew what the beduini would do to him once they caught him. He swallowed down his fear and reminded himself of his mission. He was not here to harm the locals, but to help. His studies had told him that charity was a pillar of Islam, hadn't they? He personally doubted that the Senussi tribesmen he was to meet were quite so pious. He checked his compass and map. This ridge was the site. Well, better to sit and wait out the inevitable. He slumped against his hiking pack, grateful for the chance to rest his legs. \n\nHis only warning was the slight rustle of sand crunching underfoot. He sprang up to see that he was surrounded (where the hell did they all come from?) by five hard-looking, well-armed Libyans. One stepped forward, and began in broken, stilted Italian: "What are you doing here, foreigner? You are no soldier. Do you not know that this land is protected by the Mujahid Omar al-Mukhtar? No Italian dogs are suffered to live here." \n\nGianmario stood, and began in even more broken Arabic "I know, but I must be here nonetheless. I am Doctor Gianmario Carbone, and I am here with the Medical Peace Mission. I was ordered to offer my services free of charge to any and all Libyans who request them. Would you guide me to the nearest settlement? I would like to get to work as soon as possible." \n\nAfter a thorough search of his bags, his captors (no, compatriots) returned to him. Their leader spoke again: "Very well, doctor. You may accompany us to camp. However, you will follow all of my instructions to the letter: one deviation from my commands and you will die. Understood?" \n\nHe nodded. \n\n"Good". \n\nAs the party trudged away, Gianmario began, finally, to relax. He would live to see another day, at least. Who knows-- maybe, just maybe, he could really make a difference to these people."

italy.54.d:0 "The meeting was, in all honesty, surprisingly civil. Preliminaries were drawn up quickly and efficiently, aides on both sides managing to negotiate time and place for the official meeting with ease. Carlo Sforza rubbed his chin pensively as the car sped the last few hundred meters to the large tent that would serve as conference venue. Perhaps the Senussis were getting tired of this as well, after all. \n\nNo significant errors at the beginning, thank God. Sforza was grateful that Mukhtar was conducting the negotiations personally; that should remove a great deal of uncertainty. He moved with the sharp grace of an agitated predator, only showing a hint of unfamiliar awkwardness when he sat in a chair across from Sforza. He began to speak, the translator's whispers laying over the guttural melody like oil poured over metal:\n\n"I have seen your initial conditions, but I wish to hear them one more time, now that we are conducting formal negotiations. Have any of your positions changed?" \n\n"No, general. All previously offered concessions and demands remain. All territories beyond the greater urban zones of the main coastal cities will be reorganized into an autonomous territory directed by the Senussi order. Italian land ownership in the Jabal will be restricted as you have requested, and full Italian citizenship with all the rights thereof will be immediately extended to any Libyan who requests it without preconditions. Libyans will be exempt from conscription if they do not take up citizenship and Libyan trade will be exempt from tariffs. \n\nIn return, the Senussi order will cease hostile activity against Italy, and a military exclusion zone of 200 kilometers from Italian territories will be put in force. Furthermore, the order will not object to the construction of roads, railroads and other infrastructure for our mutual benefit in the autonomous zone and allow the passage of our troops through their territory in time of war." \n\nMukhtar nodded. "These terms are acceptable. Are they final?" \n\nSforza shook his head, grinning slightly. "Not quite." \n\nMukhtar frowned. \nSforza quickly said "There are no extensions to the demands, general, I assure you. Merely a token of the government's respect for your order and its traditions." He removed a piece of paper from his briefcase. "I have been authorized to offer an annual sum of 1 million lire to your order for the purpose of funding and improving the zawiyat in your territories. No further strings attached.""

We won't. Part of our mission is to support education, and if that happens to coincide with you not killing our people, then the next step is obvious."\n\nMukhtar regained control of himself, but only for a moment; his mask of determination cracking into a broad smile.

The signs all pointed to it, and he knew the kind of men he was dealing with. He sighed, staring at the ornately molded ceiling. His life was one of service, he reminded himself. His son would undoubtedly agree. They had both been ready for this for some time, though neither wished to admit it. \n\nThree men walked in, closing the door softly behind him. As he turned, the king's suspicions were immediately confirmed. Giulio Alessio, Giovanni Amendola and Francesco Saverio Nitti-- the Unholy Trinity of liberal republicanism. Victor Emmanuel's smile was genuine; there would be no more hypocrisy now, no more dancing around the truth.\n\nNitti drew himself up to his full height. "Your Majesty, I believe you understand why we are here."\n\n"I do."\n\n"Then what is your answer?"\n\nVictor Emmanuel took a deep breath, staring Nitti directly in the eye. "My house is an ancient one, accustomed by many centuries to both ruling and reigning. However, ever since the unification, we have witnessed something new-- those who were once merely subjects have gone beyond the necessities of the past. They are no longer mere peasants, but citizens, educated and conscious. I will not cause trouble by overstaying my welcome when I am not needed." \n\nHe looked to the other two parliamentarians. "Gentlemen, I hope you will wish me no ill will. I have always tried to do what I believe is best for the country. I will do as you ask, as will Umberto. My house united Italy; we will not divide it." \n\nThe three men embraced their former king, now fellow citizen, giving him the last, best gift they could: their admiration."

Muttering a quick Ave Maria, Victor Emmanuel stepped forward and began to speak, his powerful voice battering the chamber into silence.\n\n"Senators and Deputies, we and our son the Prince of Piedmont come before you now to discharge a solemn duty, the gravest ever undertaken by our great house. In the years since the unification, this Kingdom has developed into a true jewel upon the earth. This peninsula, once divided, benighted, and endlessly rancorous has transformed into a powerful, prosperous, victorious, and learned nation. We are deeply pleased by its progress, and before us in this chamber we see assembled the best of our people, gathered to guide their fellows into a brighter future. That is the theme of my address today: the future."\n\nHe looked down at his boots for a moment, breathing deeply as he returned his gaze to the assembly. "The spectre of a new Great War once again stalks the world. In order to face the challenges ahead, the people must be truly united.

While there were cows to milk and chickens to look after, babies to bathe and children to feed, leave that foolishness to the fools. There was real work to be done, and after eighty long years and three good husbands (thank God for all of them) she was no stranger to a hard day's work.\n\nShe sucked on her pipe, staring across the village at Don Basilio's house. Holy Virgin, the man never stopped carousing-- all four seasons, in every kind of weather, he and his Palermo whores would keep the whole place awake with their damn ruckus.

He knew he was drawing looks-- Milanese suit or not, he figured it would be a while until the Italians got used to having black men in the Chigi. He silently corrected himself; he was Italian too now, after all. \n\nThe main door creaked open, and the room went quiet. Ahmed turned, expecting to see the prime minister. Instead, he was just as shocked as all the rest; in walked Vittorio Orlando, the Premier of Victory himself. He walked into the august building cool as a cucumber, only seeming to react to anyone when he spotted Ahmed beside the wall. "Governor! Good to see you! You look almost as fucking lost as I am, eh? Ha!" He shook Ahmed's hand vigorously. "I'm just kidding about all that, I know this damn tomb like the back of my hand. Shall we go?" He immediately turned and strode off, his small frame rumbling along like a shot cannonball.\n\nThe twenty-six year old Governor of Chad could barely believe it. This man had won the Great War for Italy and served in parliament for decades, and now at eighty the old bastard was still chugging, now as Governor of Sicily under the Federation. He jogged slightly to catch up, their quick and powerful steps making the floors ring. \n\nOrlando himself was amazed by the great changes he had lived through. As he walked beside his new colleague, he began to reflect on his many years-- he had lived in two kingdoms and one republic now, and had served in practically every office that mattered. Now he was walking to work with a black man as his colleague, to a conference that would feature Libyans, Turks, Albanians, Somalis, and more; not to mention every kind of Italian, and all presided over by that damned Nitti, his greatest rival. He grinned like a maniac. The good Lord had given him a strong Italy to look after, getting stronger all the time as its many peoples gathered together in true brotherhood.

Today his companion was Ferruccio Parri, who had begun to talk quite energetically about the diplomatic situation in Europe.\n\n"Mr. Prime Minister, Italy's situation has never been more precarious. We have to find a way to deal with whomever wins the coming war. We're definitely better off than we were, but are we really strong enough to stand on our own? I'm not sure it would be wise to roll those dice". He turned to see Nitti's reaction, but the man had stopped a few moments before. When Parri caught sight of him, he was shocked; Nitti's ample features had gone red, his breathing strained, his eyes flashing with rage.\n\n"Deal with them, Ferrucio? Deal with them?! I'll show you how we'll fucking deal with them!" he picked up a large stick from the ground and wrenched it, barely showing any effort as the wood strained, popped, and finally broke with a sound like a cannon going off. "I will break them, Ferruccio. Utterly." \n\nHe walked on in a huff. Parri trailed after him, hardly believing his ears. Well, he supposed, better for him to work it out in private rather than letting it show in public. He certainly sympathized: the other European regimes were disgusting, and it was vital to keep a clear head when dealing with them, so this sort of outburst was perfectly natural, actually. Parri jogged to catch up, and as the walk continued, he forgot all about Nitti's uncharacteristic outburst."

We need the people ready!"\n\n"Have a seat, Senator," the prime minister replied, unfazed by Croce's outburst. He calmly closed his office door and sat back down. "Now, I entirely agree with what you said. We do need the people ready, ready for anything. But we also need them to keep their eyes on the prize. Peace is the reward of victory, and when the time comes that is what free men will fight for: peace."\n\nCroce's brows knitted in a frown. "Now hold on, what do you mean 'when the time comes'? Do you know something we don't?"\n\nNitti's calm, stony expression did not change, but Croce thought he could see a slight glimmer of-- anticipation? Satisfaction, maybe? He couldn't quite tell. "No, Benedetto. I know everything that you know. I know that France, Germany, and so many other countries are suffering under tyranny. I know that nobody else is going to do a damn thing about it either. I know we have a responsibility to mend what has broken, and as God is my witness Senator, we will!"\n\nCroce stared, dumbfounded. By the end of his speech Nitti was standing, breathing deeply, red in the face. He had never seen the prime minister so upset or so serious. For the first time in his career, Benedetto Croce was genuinely scared by a politician. As they continued to talk, he realized something. A change had come over Nitti since the Battle of Rome; after fighting through the streets, breaking through Fascist and Socialist barricades with his own hands, something in Nitti had been dissolved. His restraint, his attachment to peace, his sense of moderation- it was utterly gone.\nAs he departed the office, the Senator wiped cold sweat from his brow, as a single thought sounded deep in his heart, over and over like a funeral dirge:"

I am proud to say that our program is nearly complete; 14 of our points are realized. However, the last is certainly the hardest. It is to secure for the future what we have now won. It is to bring peace and security to the federal republic we worked so hard to establish."\n\n"I have not dwelt on this fact, but every Italian knows it, and so now I will say it clearly. We are surrounded by bitter enemies. To the northwest, the French, who we have beaten once, are mustering their strength for a war of vengeance. To the north, the Reds seek to dominate our lives in every detail, setting individuals against each other on a class basis in order to better exercise their tyranny over all. To the east, the Balkan nations gaze hungrily on our Adriatic lands, the Turks grasp at the federal state of Anatolia, and the crowned heads of various countries conspire to place our free citizens of Eritrea and Somalia under their despotism. I could go on." \n\nAs he spoke, he seemed to transform before the eyes of the crowd. Gone was the reassuring calmness of the relaxed man that they had elected. In his place stood a man of fire, of iron determination and uncompromising certainty. He continued:\n\n"We have already realised almost all of our 15 points, even the ones that seemed unthinkable when we were elected: the universal vote, the republic, the creation of our great federation. But what about the last one? "We will fight for liberty, justice and democracy in Italy." Why should that only extend to Italy? Are we so miserly with our principles, so servile in our desire for peace today that we cannot fight for peace tomorrow? What good is it to stand by while Europe, Asia, Africa and more besides are plunged into terror and darkness? How long can we last alone in such a case? We cannot, and so we must act. Now. Not only for ourselves, but our children, and the children of the world-" \n\nHe stopped, overcome with emotion, breathing hard. When he looked up, the mask of many years of public life had fallen.

italy.75.d:0 "It was a cold day in Kiel. Francesco Saverio Nitti walked through the outskirts of the reconstruction zone of the Kiel canal, breathing in the scents of diesel exhaust, motor oil, and freshly turned earth. The work was proceeding excellently; the German engineers were every bit as good as they claimed, and the laborers, grateful for the steady, well-paying job, were diligent and effective. It should only be another two weeks before it reopened, bringing a significant increase in trade to the areas of Europe that needed it most. \n\nSo much had been lost in the past few years. Nitti did not regret his choices-- he could never regret setting men free-- but he wished every day that the cost could have been lower. Europe's total combined output had shrunk by almost a third, and though it was now rebounding, the scars would remain for many years. Priceless monuments were destroyed, cultural artifacts lost, and most of all, the nations of Europe had lost their dignity and sense of purpose. He hoped it would all be worth it. He really thought it would be, but looking out at this destruction, unleashed at his orders, it was hard to be sure.\n\nA German engineer jogged up to him, saluting sloppily. "Sir, progress is excellent. We may actually be ahead of schedule slightly- can't promise anything, but it's going well." \n\nNitti smiled wanly. He turned to the young man, a mask of seriousness forming on his face. "What is your name?"\n\n"Castorp, sir. Hermann Castorp."\n\n"Herr Castorp, then. Well Herr Castorp, I promise you this: we will bring back all that was lost. If we can't, we will build something better in its place." He looked out at the canal. "This is just the beginning. I swear that every drop of blood, every tear, every moment of sadness will be paid back tenfold with prosperity and joy." He looked back at the engineer, and was astonished. The man was smiling gently, as if to a small child. "We know you will, sir. We know. We wouldn't be here breaking our backs if we didn't believe that."\n\nAs the young man left, Nitti stood there, watching the bulldozers and backhoes at work. He was having a little trouble seeing; maybe a fog had come in off the Baltic. He sighed shakily, and relief flowed through him like the tide. The engineer, with that simple comment, had wiped away years of doubts and self-loathing. He continued to stare, spellbound, at the great work of rebuilding before him. It really was all worth it, after all. It really was."

italy.100.t:0 "La Vittoria Indiscutibile"
italy.100.d:0 "Breakthrough in the Alps! Fiume occupied! Headline after headline proclaims the glorious success of Italian arms. The French are utterly disorganized by our manly advance, and there are rumors that the Red Huns have put their forces on the French border on high alert. Sensing this danger, the French government has offered us rather generous terms of surrender. They will recognize our possession of the territories of the Regency of Carnaro, and cede to us both Alta Savoia and Tunisia, and in exchange we will demand no indemnities and vacate the rest of their lands. Furthermore, the Escadron will offer a 210-gun salute to the Italian flag, and the King will be given three works of art of his choice from the Louvre. \n\nThough we will not have the satisfaction of marching into Paris just now, there is no doubt that this is a great victory. D'Annunzio's little bandit kingdom is crushed, France is humiliated and Italy's reputation as a Great Power is now unquestionable. We have some hard work ahead of us, to be sure; the Carnaro must be properly integrated into the nation along with the new territories, our armed forces must be re-equipped, and we must digest the lessons of this mercifully short war. However, that is tomorrow's work. For today, let every church bell ring, let every village and town celebrate! Eat well, dance and be merry; today, Italy has won!"

A land turmoiled by ethnic conflict and religious infighting, the Italian occupation has shot a hole into the fabric of this divided region.\n\nThe South Slavs are also no strangers to foreign invaders and have fought off many throughout the centuries, having lived under many foreigners. The Ottoman occupation is still a beacon of nationalism, and now with the Italians coming in, a new wave of nationalist sentiment skyrockets as the violence-driven South Slavs harass Italian troops, escalating violence and pressuring the Italian Army. \n\nIf anything is for certain, it's that the South Slavs won't accept liberalization peacefully, something contrary to the wishes of the Italians. Whatever option is taken, the Italian command must weigh their options carefully as to not ignite a full-blown revolt."

italy.106.d:0 "The beautiful, archaic lands of Greece have been integrated into the Italian Federation, expanding Prime Minister Nitti's ambitions for a liberal Europe even further. Greece is highly strategic - controlling it ensures dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean. Its integration into the Italian Federation is a victory for natural law and human rights all across Europe.\n\nIrrespective of this, the Greeks are a proud and petty people. For centuries they were shackled under Ottoman rule, and this resentment towards foreign occupation is apparent as the local Greeks are antagonistic to the arrival of Italian. While current relations with the local population are mostly nonviolent, with reports of Italian soldiers playing with Greek schoolchildren, repressed tension is in the air and everyone can smell it as nationalist agitation enters its preliminary formations.\n\nDespite this, there are still some Greeks, Greeks with a romanticized view of the Byzantine and Roman period, who hail the oncoming Italian troops as a revival of the glory periods of the Greeks under the crown of the Byzantines and Romans. They, of course. are in the minority, as the Roman identity which Greeks used to hold is long gone, but their rhetoric holds the potential to inspire many to the cause of natural law, even if it is for reasons contrary to liberal rhetoric."

Sure, they were putting in a governor and keeping a parliament, but that smelled awfully fishy to Andon. Sweet Mary, it wasn't like they were hurting anybody. \n\nAs they marched through Sofia, Andon noticed an important-looking officer riding past. What a fool-- look at that stupid feather in his hat! Just as he thought this, a dark object sailed over his left shoulder and landed on the officer's chest. He looked down, and the column stopped as he called a halt, visibly shaking with outrage. As he cleaned himself off, every spectator could clearly see what had hit him. It was shit. Some joker had thrown shit at the officer. Andon got ready to run-- no way were the Italians going to take this lying down. People were going to die today, all because some moron thought he would be funny. \n\nTo his surprise, the officer straightened, threw away his filthy handkerchief, and gave the order to keep marching. The soldiers continued on without incident, some of them even grinning a little. Andon sighed, relieved; He knew it wouldn't be the last time something like this happened, and the next time someone would get hurt. This time though, he thanked God that cooler heads had prevailed, and walked home a little more at peace with the future."

The bleeding had long since stopped, but that didn't matter. He could smell the pus all the time, and if he looked down, he would only see a spider web of red radiating from an oozing, black hole the size of a lira coin. Looking up, he noticed that he was standing under an olive tree. Good a place as any to die, he thought. \n\nThose fucking Italian scum had exploded out of Antalya like a bolt of lightning. When the airplanes hit, Cemil's whole company had practically vaporized in front of him. The retreat was disastrous, Italian tanks surging around them, trucks vomiting out soldiers by the dozen in every direction. Cemil had been forced into a solo role, undertaking near-suicidal raids on occupied villages. He had killed ten Italians for sure over the last weeks, maybe twenty others he wasn't sure of. In the last raid he'd taken two bullets to the side, and the Italians were now closing in on him. They would definitely hang him, infected wounds or no.\n\nHe just couldn't stand it. The old Empire had been slaughtered in the first war, and Turkey had been carved up and handed out like pieces of lamb. Now the Italians had opened their mouths and swallowed his poor country whole. Would they ever redeem themselves? Was this simply the destiny of conquerors, to be conquered in turn? He wished he could live to see the Italians meet that fate. Oh well-- there was nothing he could do. The last of strength was leaving him. He didn't fight it. He'd had enough fighting, enough struggle, enough...\n\nHe had been dead for three hours when they found him. The doctor cursed. The stupid bastard. He had the amnesty in his pocket, but the damn fool just kept going. He shook his head, ordering his escort to dig a grave beneath the tree. He hoped the man would rest well in its shade."

italy.130.t:0 "A Meeting Too Long Deferred"
italy.130.d:0 "Carlo Sforza, Italian Minister Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Sister Republics, did not begrudge the two men before him their tearful embrace. After so many years of painful struggle, heartbreaking defeats and anxious crises, Russia was finally united and free. Vasily Maklakov and Pavel Milyukov separated, ready to get down to business.\nThough technically this was a negotiation between separate nations, the two Russians absolutely agreed on the major point: immediate reunification of the country. This meeting was really about explaining the new European system to Milyukov, and securing his blessing for Italy's temporary status as protector of Russia while it was reunified and reconstructed. As they ironed out the particulars of reunification, they invited Sforza to sit with them. \nHe began to explain, for the umpteenth time, Italy's position. "Signore Milyukov, I assure you that Italy has no desire to institute a system of protectorate nations, despite what you may have heard. The fact is that the federation has suffered mightily to liberate many nations, and thus we ask a rather modest price for our efforts. Italy requests most favored nation status for trade in Russia for three years, after which Russia will be accepted without delay into the European economic agreement we intend to create. Between now and then you may make other agreements as you please."\n"Furthermore, Russia will be obliged to keep a standing army of sufficient size to both defend itself and assist sister republics as the need should arise, with supreme allied command being held by an Italian officer for another year. By that point we should all be working closely enough that a supreme commander will no longer be necessary or could be chosen by the sister republics in concert. Finally, you must swear to maintain exclusivity of alliance with Italy and the other recognized sister republics, and sign a permanent treaty of non-aggression and cooperation with all of them. Are these terms acceptable?"\nMilyukov sniffed. The terms were acceptable, even desirable in the short term-- he and his colleagues had a lot of damage to fix. Nevertheless it was still a bit galling for Russia to be dictated to so bluntly by such an upstart power. Milyukov smiled tightly. "I certainly accept. We do owe you much, though I hope that in future talks we can negotiate on a more… level basis?"\nSforza nodded his understanding. "Certainly, sir, and we will. This is a revolutionary period, and such times are always full of danger, as you well know. However, as things begin to settle down, I assure you that we will be true to our word, and will grant you the full dignity you deserve." He stood. "If there is nothing more gentlemen, I will take my leave."\nMilyukov rose, walked over and clasped him in a hug, surprisingly strong for his age. "Thank you," Milyukov whispered. "You have given us so much. We will never forget it.""

Could you imagine!? The soul of Europe would not survive another such trial, and we, as its originators, would be damned in turn,\" spoke the Secretary for State, his brow furrowed.\n\n\"Many men would not survive another such trial, either!\" exclaimed the Foreign Minister. \"An intervention in Italy would be war, and then all of Europe would be in danger. And do you not think that after Italy, the Dutch would follow the next day, and the Germans the day after? The dead would fill the Rhine on the back of our bloodthirst. If the Italians want peace, then they shall have it!\"\n\n\"The nation is simply not ready for war. Not ours, and not the Italians' either,\" chimed in the Minister for War. \"Were we to stand by Italy, there would be French troops in Calais by nightfall. Shipping in the Channel and the Mediterranean would be in grave danger, the Empire would be choked, and the fleets are not yet arranged to protect them. Arditi would be in Venice, and raiders would be torpedoing ships off Sicily, before we could land a single army on the Italian peninsula.\"\n\n"Our intervention would destroy not just peace, but the international order across Europe. This business is between the Italians — it need not include us. The diplomatic game is a delicate one, after all,\" stated Lord Perth, smiling serenely. He had been whisked away from a round of golf to attend; his bright, multi-coloured Argyle sweater stuck out like a sore thumb amid the suits around him. \"Britannia may rule the waves, but she cannot waive the rules.\"\n\nA chorus of gentlemanly laughter broke out over the table; and with it, the fate of Italy was sealed."

Indeed, much of Italian society was no doubt panicking at the revelations from London. But here, in this humble newsagents in a humble Italian town, was an oasis of total calm. Massimo was a humble man, and so was his father before him; he had inherited his sense of total unflappability, too — watching him work through the darkest days of the Great War had taught the young man a valuable lesson. Unlike some, he knew that the Sun would rise tomorrow, just as it had this morning, and it would rise again the day after, and the day after that, and with the Sun would come townsfolk waiting to buy his newspapers; they needed to be sure that the Sun would rise once more, even if Massimo did not.\n\nCertainly, the news was not good for the nation. Britain abandoning their military commitments and years of vague promises to the Savoyard monarchy, all in exchange for a peace that everyone knew could not last, did not seem like pragmatic diplomacy, in spite of how many time the English diplomats stressed the phrase. Perhaps he would be called up to serve, perhaps not. It mattered little. The languid pace of provincial life had had its effects, too.\n\nArranging the crisp pages of the 'Corriere della Sera' on his shelves, next to the venerable 'La Stampa' and the incensed 'Idea Nazionale', Massimo smiled at a job well done. Today was going to be a good day, he said to himself, eyes lingering on the sensational headlines, no matter what came. And so it would go, day after day, until the sky caved in."

Better to lose a seat in parliament or two than dozens of lives to civil disorder."
ITA_peace_overseas:0 "Peace Overseas"
ITA_peace_overseas_desc:0 "Libya is the Devil's own playground, and the equatorial territories were never properly organized. Let's take the first steps to peace in our overseas territories."
ITA_many_carrots:0 "Many Carrots, One Stick"
ITA_many_carrots_desc:0 "We have a lot to offer the peoples of the territories-- education, healthcare, a far higher standard of living, and they'll get all of it even if they don't take citizenship. However, attacks on our citizens and their property are unacceptable, and we will respond with appropriate force to all such incidents."
ITA_pacifying_libya:0 "Pacifying Libya"
ITA_pacifying_libya_desc:0 "Oh, Libya. Libya, Libya, Libya. Land of olives, beautiful cities, and a bloody guerrilla war against the Senussis. This needs to stop immediately. We will empower Carlo Sforza, our former foreign minister, as our Minister Plenipotentiary to the Senussi Order. He'll get us out of this damn mess."
ITA_equatorial_order:0 "Order in the Horn"
ITA_equatorial_order_desc:0 "The situation in the Horn of Africa is far less grave than Libya, but it is still far too confused. British colonials, Italian settlers, and natives of many tribes and nations all jockey for influence on the desks of our governors. We must revitalize that administration and prepare it for top-to-bottom restructuring."
ITA_reversing_slump:0 "Reversing the Slump"
ITA_reversing_slump_desc:0 "We are off to a good start, but our greatest challenges lie ahead. Fixing Italy's economic problems will not be simple-- lasting damage from the Great War coupled with the Crash of '31 have left Italy gasping for breath. It's time to put our know-how to the test and achieve prosperity for every Italian!"
ITA_sandwich_theory:0 "Sandwich Theory"
ITA_sandwich_theory_desc:0 "The Prime Minister has developed a novel approach to our economic concerns. In order to grow the meat of our economy, industry, we have to strengthen the "bread"-- the agricultural and financial sectors. Once the two bedrock sectors of the economy are secured, high-paying industrial jobs will grow!"
ITA_italian_farmer:0 "The Italian Farmer"
ITA_italian_farmer_desc:0 "Our farmers have been devastated by outdated methods, collapsing prices and increased international protectionism. We need to support our farmers with modernization, land consolidation and plain old fiscal relief. Get the checkbook!"
ITA_temporary_direct:0 "Temporary Direct Payments"
ITA_temporary_direct_desc:0 "We're just going to give the farmers free money for a bit-- not forever, just until things stabilize. Buy the wife something nice!"
ITA_non_production:0 "Non-production Subsidies"
ITA_non_production_desc:0 "Farmers typically react to hard times by bringing more goods to market, further lowering prices and reinforcing vicious cycles of overproduction and poverty. We will establish a board to approve subsidies for reduced production, replacing lost income and stabilizing food prices at the same time."
ITA_farming_protection:0 "The Farming Protection Act"
ITA_farming_protection_desc:0 "This will not be the last farming crisis we face. This act will establish a Ministry of Agriculture to act as a guardian of Italian farmers in all situations and address their needs quickly."
ITA_encourage_local:0 "Encourage Local Purchases"
ITA_encourage_local_desc:0 "It's not enough to boost farmers by spending our tax revenue. We need the populace to support our farmers. Therefore, the government has started a "Buy Local" campaign for restaurants and grocers. Supporting our neighbors is our best weapon against price instability and sectoral poverty!"
ITA_freeze_land:0 "Freeze Land Sales and Foreclosures"
ITA_freeze_land_desc:0 "Our proud farmers should not be forced out of a living based on a crisis they had no part in. We will freeze some sales of agricultural land and all farm foreclosures in order for our other policies to have time to save marginal cases."
ITA_pick_litter:0 "Pick of the Litter"
ITA_pick_litter_desc:0 "The Government has decided to create an Agricultural Land Board to offer farmers incentives for better land management. Those less well-off will be given first right of refusal on good land for sale, while those better off will receive free advice on the most modern land management methods."
ITA_best_deal:0 "The Best Deal in Town"
ITA_best_deal_desc:0 "We will expand the powers of the ALB to offer government loans at sub-market rates to allow successful farmers to purchase land. If you can make it productive, you ought to buy it."
ITA_cash_kit:0 "Cash and Kit"
ITA_cash_kit_desc:0 "The most meaningful thing we can do for our farmers is to help them modernize their equipment. By offering cash to buy tractors, harvesters etc. or by just buying the kit for them ourselves, we can help thousands of farmers embrace modernity."
ITA_sustainable_surplus:0 "Sustainable Surplus"
ITA_sustainable_surplus_desc:0 "Finally, the twin curses of overproduction and over-export are at an end! Italian food prices are low and stable, and farmers are earning better than ever. We can now afford to end some of our temporary programs. Let's raise a glass to the Italian farmer!"
ITA_desert_markets:0 "The Desert Markets"
ITA_desert_markets_desc:0 "In terms of liquidity, our credit markets are a barren wasteland. The Crash and repeated runs on banks throughout the country have turned "Italian credit" into an oxymoron. We must take drastic steps to rescue our final sector."
ITA_run_presses:0 "For Once, Run the Presses"
ITA_run_presses_desc:0 "We have seen some of the disastrous consequences of hyperinflation, but now we are experiencing the reverse. We must end deflation, at almost any cost. Therefore we will begin to borrow from the central bank and use that money to fund our projects. Let's get the water flowing."
ITA_bottom_rates:0 "Bottom out the Rates"
ITA_bottom_rates_desc:0 "Of course, we cannot be the sole beneficiaries of a looser monetary policy. We will take the unprecedented step of setting the prime interest rate at zero. Let's make history."
ITA_power_flow:0 "The Power of Flow"
ITA_power_flow_desc:0 "We are beginning to see signs that deflationary tendencies are reversing, and the funds made available by the Bank of Italy are finally beginning to circulate. We finally have the monetary foundation to rescue Italian credit."
ITA_have_bank:0 "Have a Bank!"
ITA_have_bank_desc:0 "Our banks are not just dead metaphorically-- the branch buildings are literal ruins from years of disuse. We can employ thousands to rebuild old branches or build new ones, which we will sell to financial entrepreneurs at a discount."
ITA_royal_deposit:0 "The Royal Deposit Insurance Concern"
ITA_royal_deposit_desc:0 "Banks are built on confidence as much as they are built on brick and mortar. Therefore we will institute a deposit insurance scheme to protect both banks and depositors from runs on the bank, insuring accounts up to 30,000 lire."
ITA_walk_dont_run:0 "Walk, Don't Run, to Italian Credit"
ITA_walk_dont_run_desc:0 "The Italian banking sector is back. We finally have the confidence and institutional foundation to rebuild Italian credit."
ITA_flood_market:0 "Flood the Money Market"
ITA_flood_market_desc:0 "One of the most neglected sectors of our credit market thus far is the "money market": the market for bonds that mature in a few weeks or months rather than years, which helps to keep struggling businesses afloat and lets successful ones float free cash in a profitable way. The Treasury will issue a slate of government money market bonds to renew interest in this vital sector."
ITA_encourage_public:0 "Encourage Public Listings"
ITA_encourage_public_desc:0 "In the public imagination, the stock market is associated with irresponsibility, out-of-touch fat cats, and gamblers. This ignores the genuine value of the stock market as a tool for valuation and long-term investment. We need to encourage new entrepreneurs to list their companies publicly, and lower the regulatory threshold for listings. Invest Italian!"
ITA_desert_no_more:0 "A Desert No More"
ITA_desert_no_more_desc:0 "Our energetic, experimental policy has caused a new blooming of Italian credit. Our financial sector is back, and ready for action. They'll have all the action they can get soon enough. Let's raise a glass to the Italian banker!"

ITA_royal_bureau_works:0 "The Royal Bureau for Public Works"
ITA_royal_bureau_works_desc:0 "Economists joke about paying people to dig ditches, but many of our roads are just wide ditches already. We will establish a central bureau to coordinate public works projects to give Italians both the jobs and infrastructure they deserve."
ITA_royal_bureau_munitions:0 "The Royal Bureau for Munitions and Armaments"
ITA_royal_bureau_munitions_desc:0 "We cannot let our war materials production potential be subject to the whims of the economy. We will establish a bureau for war production, both to coordinate efforts in wartime and ensure that we can expand our production capacity in peacetime."
ITA_reforming_welfare:0 "Reforming our Welfare"
ITA_reforming_welfare_desc:0 "The Italian welfare system is highly antiquated and inefficient, and the individual offices are highly corrupt. We should streamline our efforts to provide an effective baseline relief package."

ITA_welfare_inspectorate:0 "The General Welfare Inspectorate"
ITA_welfare_inspectorate_desc:0 "Corruption and fraud in welfare must be eradicated. We will establish an inspectorate to monitor our offices and charities that have taken government money, as well as to fight the more obvious fraudsters. This will greatly improve the impact of the money we spend."
ITA_seed_grants:0 "Seed Grants"
ITA_seed_grants_desc:0 "It is rather difficult to start a new charity in these uncertain times. Therefore the government will provide seed grants to those who wish to start new charitable organizations, getting them over the first hurdles. The most valuable help is freely given help."
ITA_status_quo:0 "Status Quo Ante Ruinam"
ITA_status_quo_desc:0 "The newest numbers are in-- our current economic state is the same as it would be if we had 5% growth per annum since 1931 without any crash at all. That is truly remarkable. However..."
ITA_do_better:0 "We can do better"
ITA_do_better_desc:0 "We can still do better. Our majority is strong, the public is behind us, and we have unprecedented political energy behind us. We will never stop working for a better Italy."
ITA_the_south:0 "To the South"
ITA_the_south_desc:0 "Our Prime Minister is one of the most famous meridionalists in Italy-- he and his fellow theorists have spilled hogsheads of ink on how to reform Southern Italy, a land traditionally wracked by poverty, illiteracy, and organized crime. They are Italians too, and they deserve the best from us. We will turn the full focus and power of His Majesty's Government to bringing the South up to full economic and administrative parity with the North, once and for all."
ITA_labour_loan:0 "Labour-Loan Programs"
ITA_labour_loan_desc:0 "First, agriculture. Southern land management is so bad that an enormous amount of land goes wild or fallow for lack of appropriately allocated labor. We will offer farmers low-interest loans for the purpose of hiring unemployed locals to bring this land under cultivation, and unemployed locals will get similar loans to purchase such land to start farms of their own."
ITA_tools_techniques:0 "Tools and Techniques"
ITA_tools_techniques_desc:0 "If northern farms are merely backwards, southern farms are downright medieval. Some farmers in Sicily have never even used a seed drill, let alone adopted scientific farming methods! We will authorize the Ministry of Agriculture to establish agronomy schools and send advisers to the farmers of Southern Italy."
ITA_end_corruption:0 "End Corruption"
ITA_end_corruption_desc:0 "Corruption is a perennial problem of bureaucracy, but in Southern Italy it is practically a way of life. We must move energetically to eliminate local sinecures and patronage networks and put in place a bureaucratic culture of civic responsibility and upright service."
ITA_arrest_crimelords:0 "Arrest the Crime Lords"
ITA_arrest_crimelords_desc:0 "Mafioso just means "man of honor"; however we cannot let the admirable virtues of Southern Italian gentlemen such as Vittorio Orlando become a cover for murderers, thieves and petty tyrants. The government has been given extensive anti-racketeering and mob-busting powers. Let's use them."
ITA_southern_industries:0 "Southern Core Industries"
ITA_southern_industries_desc:0 "In order to achieve parity, we can't just build a bunch of luxury goods factories in the south and call it good. Industrial capacity and know-how must be spread throughout the country in order to prevent further concentration. Therefore we will establish core goods industries, such as steel plants and oil refineries, under the auspices of the Bureaus for armaments and public works to ensure that knowledge and capacity can be evenly spread."
ITA_producing_export:0 "Producing for Export"
ITA_producing_export_desc:0 "With our capital goods concerns coming online in the South, we can expand to consumer goods production. The stigma of Southern Italian backwardness can be best overturned by making it the gold standard of consumer goods production."
ITA_new_arsenals:0 "Open New Arsenals"
ITA_new_arsenals_desc:0 "As well as capital and consumer industries, we must expand our military production in Southern Italy. Diversifying our physical war production plant will give us far more staying power in any conflict and further relieve unemployment in the south."
ITA_naval_works:0 "The Naval Works Program"
ITA_naval_works_desc:0 "Naples, Taranto, Palermo, etc.; the list of strategically valuable Southern Italian port cities is extensive. Since between our coastline and overseas territories Italy is a natural naval power, let's make a substantial investment in naval construction and fleet infrastructure in the Mezzogiorno."
ITA_parity_at_last:0 "Parity at Last"
ITA_parity_at_last_desc:0 "We have done the unthinkable. Relative to population, we are on track to achieve GDP parity between Northern and Southern Italy within two years. This is one of the most important moments in Italian economic history. If nothing else, this government will be forever remembered for this titanic achievement!"
ITA_across_seas:0 "Across the Seas"
ITA_across_seas_desc:0 "We have spent many months solving the numerous economic problems of metropolitan Italy, but our territories are still in need of significant attention. Now that we have a free moment, let's turn our attention south and address these problems before they get out of control."
ITA_western_lands:0 "The Western Lands"
ITA_western_lands_desc:0 "Our overseas lands west of Suez have historically been much more troublesome than our older colonies. Libya is the obvious example, and Tunisia joining it after we offered them sanctuary from the new French regime. Let's get to it."
ITA_libya_soclib:0 "North Africa"
ITA_libya_soclib_desc:0 "North Africa is the obvious starting point. We have peace, but we need to reassure the Senussi that we mean to follow our agreements, in letter and in spirit."
ITA_settlement_grants:0 "Settlement Grants"
ITA_settlement_grants_desc:0 "Though we agreed to restrict Italian settlement in some of the most fertile areas of the North African coast, there are certainly areas that require settlement in our zones of control. We will offer grants to those who wish to start a new life overseas, both in order to strengthen our hold on these territories and to remind the Africans that Italy is a nation of regular, kind people, not violent anti-insurgent warriors."
ITA_rights_theory:0 "Rights in Theory, Rights in Practice"
ITA_rights_theory_desc:0 "It is utterly critical that we hold to our agreements on all points. Therefore we will establish an inspectorate empowered to remove officials with a colonialist mindset. The Libyans and Tunisians are brother Italians, not enemies, nor subhumans."
ITA_roads_village:0 "Roads to Every Village"

ITA_industralise_cities:0 "Industralise the Cities"
ITA_industralise_cities_desc:0 "The Maghreb's cities are quite beautiful, but rather poor by the standards of the Peninsula. Let's bring valuable industrial jobs to the region."
ITA_tunis:0 "Tunis"
ITA_tunis_desc:0 "Tunis - once ancient Carthage - was the capital of the French Protectorate of Tunisia. Now that the land is ours, let us show the Tunisians that they were right to jump ship and swear allegiance to Rome."
ITA_benghazi:0 "Benghazi"
ITA_benghazi_desc:0 "Benghazi is the unofficial capital of Cyrenaica. We must develop the city further in order to enrich the region."
ITA_tripoli:0 "Tripoli"
ITA_tripoli_desc:0 "Tripoli is easily the greatest city in the whole of Libya, but much can be done to bring it up to the 20th century."
ITA_tobruk:0 "Tobruk"

ITA_improve_links:0 "Improve Transport Links"
ITA_improve_links_desc:0 "We must be able to move troops from Tunis to Tobruk as easily as we move them in Europe. Let's commission some new highways."
ITA_further_down:0 "Reiterate the Legge Fondamentale"
ITA_further_down_desc:0 "Signed in 1919, the Legge Fondamentale enshrined the colonial rights of the long-suffering Libyan population. Now that that cruel war is over, we can reinvest into North Africa - not as adversaries, but as brothers."
ITA_securing_communication:0 "Securing Communications"
ITA_securing_communication_desc:0 "In time of war we cannot guarantee that we will be able to send naval forces out of the Mediterranean. Let's ensure that we won't lose contact with neither the densest cities nor the most far-flung oasis."
ITA_cutting_sand:0 "Cutting through the Sand"
ITA_cutting_sand_desc:0 "The workhorse of the desert - the humble camel - has for centuries been the only option for travel within much of Libya. But with the modern railway, perhaps it is time to give the poor beasts a well-earned retirement."
ITA_eastern_colonies:0 "The Eastern Colonies"
ITA_eastern_colonies_desc:0 "Our eastern territories of Eritrea and Somalia are our oldest possessions overseas, with Ethiopia joining them much more recently. Though colonies no longer, we still have significant reforms to make to finalize their territorial status."
ITA_eritrea_soclib:0 "Eritrea"
ITA_eritrea_soclib_desc:0 "Truly our model territory, Eritrea is the most peaceful and Italian of our overseas possession. However antiquated policies and local geography have kept this region back for too long; let's give this our attention."
ITA_somalia_soclib:0 "Somalia"
ITA_somalia_soclib_desc:0 "Somalia is, alas, rather less well-developed than Eritrea despite its valuable strategic position. We can fix that."
ITA_racial_laws:0 "End the Racial Laws"
ITA_racial_laws_desc:0 "Italians are Italians are Italians, no matter their skin color. End all racial laws throughout colonies immediately."
ITA_gateway_east:0 "Our Gateway to the East"

ITA_the_jewel_in_the_crown:0 "The Jewel in the Crown"
ITA_the_jewel_in_the_crown_desc:0 "A victory decades in the making, our triumph in Ethiopia has truly put Italian Colonialism on the map. We would be fools to not utilise its abundant population and plentiful resources."
ITA_sprawling_tracks:0 "Sprawling Tracks"
ITA_sprawling_tracks_desc:0 "To enable the use of this new and bountiful territory, and to develop its productive capacity, a great infrastructure overhaul is needed. One would hope that our railway engineers treat the mountains as a pleasant challenge, rather than an unwelcome hindrance."
ITA_heaving_earth:0 "Heaving Earth"
ITA_heaving_earth_desc:0 "There's gold in them their mountains — and much more besides! Iron, tantalum, and other rare earth minerals abound just under the surface, ripe for extraction."
ITA_far_east_naval:0 "The Far East Naval Station"
ITA_far_east_naval_desc:0 "Italy must maintain the capacity to project naval power in the Indian ocean even if the Suez is closed; therefore the navy ministry has decided to greatly expand naval infrastructure in Somalia."
ITA_economic_integration:0 "Local Economic Integration"
ITA_economic_integration_desc:0 "The best customers for Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia are, well, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia! If we can promote significant local trade we can weld these three territories into a unified economic region."
ITA_antalya_soclib:0 "Il Dodecaneso"
ITA_antalya_soclib_desc:0 "The Dodecanese islands are a bit of an odd duck among our possessions: though its people are Italian citizens, its primary purpose is to keep Turkey neutralized and to maintain a presence in the eastern Medditeranean. Let us try to normalize its status."
ITA_fortify_cession:0 "Fortify the Cession"
ITA_fortify_cession_desc:0 "Our prize, won gracefully and fairly in the Italo-Turkish war, still draws ire in Anatolia — especially now that the Straits Commission has fallen through. We must prepare the Turkish Cession to weather the storm of a new war."
ITA_state_airline:0 "A State Airline"
ITA_state_airline_desc:0 "It is critical to the integrity of our country that an Italian be able to fly between our territories quickly; however, there just isn't enough demand for this yet for a private company to fill the void. Therefore the government will establish a for-profit state airline to guarantee quick and reliable transport between all corners of the country."
ITA_armed_services_reform:0 "Armed Services Reform"
ITA_armed_services_reform_desc:0 "Our armed forces are fucking pitiful. Absolutely fucking pitiful. They are commanded by corrupt, venal, back-stabbing incompetents, and though the average soldier fights like a lion, the supporting arms are stuck in the last century in every branch. We must defend the common soldier as he defends us."
ITA_the_navy:0 "The Navy"
ITA_the_navy_desc:0 "The Regia Marina is a bit less incomptetent than the army, but they are very much obsessed by cannon numbers and large surface ship maneuvers. Naval warfare is moving on; we can't afford to be left behind."
ITA_underwater_threat:0 "Underwater Threat"
ITA_underwater_threat_desc:0 "The Great War showed the power that a well-managed submarine fleet can have. We need to understand both how to use these ships and how to neutralize their potential to hurt us."
ITA_carriers_and_battleships:0 "Carriers and Battleships"
ITA_carriers_and_battleships_desc:0 "Though the battleship is waning, it is not quite dead yet. Even a carrier-centric navy must have significant surface support, and other applications like shore bombardment will keep battleships close to the heart of our doctrine. What's the next step for our capital ships?"
ITA_excercise_naval_invasions:0 "Excercise Naval Invasions"
ITA_excercise_naval_invasions_desc:0 "Being able to take wars overseas requires a thorough understanding of amphibious operations. Army units as well as marines will receive extensive training in this special form of warfare."

ITA_modern_weapon_design:0 "Modern Weapon Design"

ITA_overwhelming_thunder:0 "Overwhelming Thunder"
ITA_overwhelming_thunder_desc:0 "The artillery served us quite well in the Great War. Though it probably won't have the same application in future conflicts, let's examine what we can do with our steel orchestra."
ITA_unbreakable_vehicles:0 "Unbreakable Vehicles"
ITA_unbreakable_vehicles_desc:0 "Our industrial plant isn't large enough to produce a large fleet of light armor, and we couldn't use those in the Alps anyway. Therefore, let's focus on creating infantry support tanks that can act as mobile hardpoints for infantry maneuvers."
ITA_the_airforce:0 "The Air Force"
ITA_the_airforce_desc:0 "Those in the know tell us that an independent air force is the right way to go. Let's make a new service dedicated to this increasingly important form of combat."

ITA_devastation_from_above:0 "Devastation from Above"
ITA_devastation_from_above_desc:0 "Our theorists predict that air power will be best used at the strategic rather than tactical scale. Let's prepare a strategic strike force to cripple enemy logistics."
ITA_combined_exercises:0 "Combined Total Exercises"
ITA_combined_exercises_desc:0 "Most importantly, the services must be able to work together seamlessly. A series of combined exercises will help to create channels of cooperation."
ITA_regiment_the_complex:0 "Regimenting the Complex"
ITA_regiment_the_complex_desc:0 "Organizing the nation's economic power in wartime is one of the reasons any government exists in the first place.

ITA_departament_of_mil_logistics:0 "Departament of Military Logistics"
ITA_departament_of_mil_logistics_desc:0 "Producing gear is one thing, getting it to the men on time is quite another. Let's create a universal department of military logistics outside any branch to ensure everything gets to where it's needed on time."

ITA_empower_staff_desc:0 "Every successful military in the world has a strong staff section-- these are the brains of the army. Every decision at the strategic level, and many at the operational level, should receive staff input."
ITA_fund_further_research:0 "Fund Further Research"

ITA_mediterranean_security_desc:0 "Italy is the greatest nation of the Mediterranean Sea, and we must be prepared to uphold that status with action.

ITA_new_global_workshop:0 "A New Global Workshop"
ITA_new_global_workshop_desc:0 "As our earlier economic reforms take concrete effect, Italian industry and trade has exploded. Though not quite reaching American or British quality just yet, "Made in Italy" is now synonymous with reliability and artisan quality workmanship, and our goods can be found in every country on earth."
ITA_fundamental_reform:0 "Fundamental Reform"
ITA_fundamental_reform_desc:0 "Nitti has promised fundamental reforms to the Italian Constitution, but so far he has been rather vague. Oh well, it's probably just technical stuff..."

ITA_italian_federation:0 "The Italian Federation"
ITA_italian_federation_desc:0 "Not only that, but Italy is now a federation, with the peninsular states and overseas territories having administrative equality and a council of governors being added to advise the government. I guess the PRI is pretty radical after all!"

ITA_anti_totalitarianism:0 "Anti-Totalitarianism"
ITA_anti_totalitarianism_desc:0 "Our enemies hide behind labels like "anti-futurism" and "anti-socialism" to disguise their depraved lust for power. Liberty does not compromise.

ITA_wars_of_liberation_desc:0 "The people are ready to free their oppressed and deluded brothers and sisters abroad, but we must make extensive material preparations. Rifles, tanks, planes, and a thousand other articles must be brought to bear against the enemy."
ITA_paneuropean_alliance:0 "Pan-European Alliance"
ITA_paneuropean_alliance_desc:0 "The Revolutions of 1848 were sabotaged by a lack of international coordination, and the people of Europe were forced into increasingly degrading slavery. We will call the remaining European democracies to arms. We will accept no protestations of neutrality; they will be with us now, or when we occupy their capitals. It is only a matter of time."
ITA_take_down_vanguardists:0 "Take Down Communists"
ITA_take_down_vanguardists_desc:0 "There is zero difference between revolutionary communists and reactionary nationalists. Both love to incite terror for the sake of bringing about their twisted ideas of justice. What puts them apart is the communists' desire to spread their revolution globally. We must strike Germany and prevent the flood from spilling out!"
ITA_crush_accelerationists:0 "Crush Accelerationists"
ITA_crush_accelerationists_desc:0 "Accelerationists are madmen who perform nation-wide experiments and are willing to burn the world down to realise their bizzare visions of the future. We must crush the french and everyone who followed their footsteps!"
ITA_annihilate_reactionaries:0 "Annihilate Reactionaries"
ITA_annihilate_reactionaries_desc:0 "No one opposes the rights of man more than the admirers of the old order. They are religious zealots and raving narcissists who are only interested in perserving the hierarchy in which they decide who is worthy of living freely.
