leb.1.t:0 "Welcome to Lebanon"
leb.1.desc:0 "As a safe, British-backed harbor for French anti-accelerationists of all stripes, Lebanon has been at the edges of the Syrian government, with French refugees becoming an extreme problem as they arrived by the thousands. Despite all this, the Kingdom of Syria had managed to hold on to its southern elements for a while...\n\n Until now, of course, with our declaration of peaceful independence from our Arab masters after Israel's success in its war of independence. With this, local French generals commanded small mostly French militias to seize Beirut and declare the French Mandate of Lebanon, which seeks to function as essentially a government for safe harbor of other French refugees. Of course, conquest of actual French territory is impossible, so we must keep to creating a new France here, in Lebanon."
leb.1.a:0 "These great mountains will know our name."
leb.2.t:0 "An Attempt"
leb.2.desc:0 "Henri Dentz, talking to Gouraud, has realized that the constant stream of French refugees to our lands, even if they appear negligible to Artaud and his lackeys, are crucial to maintaining our rule. With this, Dentz has begin drafting up a plan for the invasion of the Kingdom of Syria, now inevitably weakened by the lack of British assistance and encroached to much smaller territory. Thusly, Dentz believes, the plan to seize Damascus in our favor and restore the French Mandate of Lebanon and Syria is essential to strengthen ourselves against any potential foreign invaders, and subsequently secure our situation where we can bring in more refugees from France, and subsequently slowly transform this land into a France like any other. Gouraud, listening to these ambitions, has decided to..."
leb.2.a:0 "Agree with the plan."
leb.2.b:0 "Disagree with the plan; we have enough space."
leb.3.t:0 "We have succeeded!"
leb.3.desc:0 "After a grueling war with hundreds, if not thousands of casualties on both sides, we have managed to restore all lands of the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon! Pro-French demonstrators have gone out in the streets for us, waving the French tricolor and a beautiful cedar tree in front of the white stripe. We will be able to finally secure our place in the Middle East as an European territory!"
leb.3.a:0 "Vive le Liban et Syrie!"
