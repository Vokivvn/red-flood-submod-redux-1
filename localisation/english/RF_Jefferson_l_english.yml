#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_KURENKOV_DESC:0 "Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Kurenkov has not been the man he is for most of his life. His sudden rise to power in Jefferson occured via the weakness of the Jeffersonian government in dealing with minorities, and subsequently, riling the Russian emigrés in Jefferson (Northern California in general being a place of large Slavic immigration during the 1910s) behind his esoteric ideals regarding the Book of Veles, a mysterious and complicated book about an ancient, unspecified land which had long been the true cosmic homeland of the Slavs. Despite the lack of specification, one thing is said for certain: It is a land of seven rivers beyond the ocean. This, to Kurenkov, felt like proof that the ancient Slavs, originating from the Ancient Native Americans, emigrated through the Atlantic towards Eastern Europe. Knowing full well that the task ahead of him is nearly impossible, Kurenkov understands the importance of restoring the ancient homeland of the Slavs - and albeit his support base is not the largest, his concept that the ancient Slavic spirit can be \"revived\" among Anglos and other ethnicities of America, as the \"cosmic Slavic sky\" cannot be removed from it's ancient homeland. Therefore, his famous (at least in California and Jefferson) conversions and initiations have made him into a controversial but otherwise fascinating figure. It is unknown, however, if his grand conquest from a tiny starting point will succeed."

jef.1.t:0 "A Cosmic Realization"
jef.1.desc:0 "During a dark night in the cold days of the forest lands, akin to Siberia - yet a little tamer, Kurenkov wrote with his quill and slowly drank a glass of vodka, imported from Yakutia to his new homeland. It was difficult to come across, and expensive, but it was needed to keep him going during these terrifying days of ruling a country, when everything he did at most back in the days he lived in Russia was simple commanding of divisions - and of course, a man realizes they cannot control a country like divisions once they rule it.\n\nA knocking began on his door, and so he placed his vodka glass on the table, slowly getting up and putting on his fur coat - People usually don't come knocking at his private home, so it must be something important, especially this late.\n\n\"Vozhd Kurenkov! I am so glad to see you!\", said the voice of a young man, tired blue eyes with gleaming shine looking at Kurenkov as if he was their hero. The young man wore a warm coat, and seemed to try his best to say a few words in Russian.\n\n\"Privyet - is everything alright? Do you need some shelter?\"said Kurenkov, in a heavily Russian accent, albeit perfect English from living in America for two decades.\n\n\"Nyet, nyet! I just wanted to tell you how happy I am to finally see you. I had felt so lost all my life, so strongly wanting to see the Russian Empire - I had such an ardent love for Russia and everything it stood for, and it saddens my heart so much to see it fall to corruption and misery. When you took over, I began crying out of joy, because I knew from your speech that it was true. I have read the partial existing transcripts of the Book of Veles and I couldn't feel any closer to what it said. All I had to say was, blagodaryu vas! blagodaryu vas for everything you've done to save America!\" The young man looked a little tearful.\n\n\"My child, that was incredibly moving. I'm glad that someone understands.\"\n\nThe two entered and continued their discussion, chatting about everything they could think of, until the break of dawn."

jef.2.t:0 "Initiation"
jef.2.desc:0 "The gathering of people across the floor in the new Institut Probuzhdeniya Drevney Ameriki began, as people of various backgrounds, sometimes even coming from as far as Los Angeles, had been patiently awaiting their Awakening as Slavs. They sat in a circle, with Kurenkov in the middle - and so one of his assistants began drumming slowly, as Kurenkov slowly cited the Book of Veles, especially one of the most important lines, dedicating the book to the ancient Slavic God Veles, and slowly citing the tales of the ancient Slavs from the \"land of seven rivers beyond the ocean\", and as the native Americans dwindled and died out from the Anglo's destruction, they thought of ancient Slavia, with it's beautiful swastikas and cosmic light. The drumming got stronger now, and so people began to cry as they felt their ancient Slavic memories from past lives return, their shaking bodies feeling a crisis of identity, as they began uttering words akin to those in the book out of their own volition. People began to squirm, to weep, to laugh, ready to live a new life as Slavians, as the first true Slavs. some of the people there were of Native American descent, and began to really feel as if their rituals and culture might have been originated from ancient Slavs. Perhaps, perhaps it was all true. Perhaps it just felt right."
