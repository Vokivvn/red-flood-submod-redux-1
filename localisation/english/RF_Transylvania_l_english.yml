#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_FORIS_DESC:0 "Stefan Foris, also known as István Fóris, is a native of Transylvania, currently serving as the Chairman of the Communist Party of Transylvania. First drafted to the Austro-Hungarian Army, where he rose up to the rank of a lieutenant, immediately after Hungary's withdrawal he took part in what was to become the Great Socialist March Revolution, viewed by some as the continuation of the previous, republican, revolution. When the Alba Iulia assembly declared the Secession of Transylvania, Foris took part in what would be known as the War of Union against the Kingdom of Romania, eventually won by the loyal socialists, who got \"rewarded\" with a degree of autonomy that still left Transylvania de jure under Hungarian jurisdiction, but de facto it was made an independent, albeit closely linked to Hungary, state. Where his role comes up in all of this, however, is his first election to the post of the Chairman - initially suggested as a compromise candidate that could alleviate the differences between Romanians and Hungarians, he was, and still is, an overseer lobbied for by the government in Budapest, aiming to convince the populace that Transylvania's place is with the much closer ideologically socialists in Hungary. So far, Transylvania has gotten moderately close to full integration, and Foris suspects that it will take place around 1942. That is, if everything goes according to the plan."
POLITICS_PAUKER_DESC:0 "Ana Pauker, born in Moldavia, is the unwilling leader of the \"Alba Iulia faction\" inside the Communist Party of Transylvania. Initially a supporter of Foris' policies, she soon began to see that the only way forward for Transylvania that would not end in a disaster, was the reunification of Romania under a communist banner. This has since been dubbed as the \"pragmatic strategy\" for the country and found much support among the ethnically Romanian members of the party. While she herself still remains a committed follower of Leninism, she recognizes that some temporary compromises must be made to fulfill the goal, hence the cooperation with the other parties against Foris."
POLITICS_FLUREAS_DESC:0 "Ioan Flureas is the leader of the \"Patriots-Democrats\" of the Ploughmen's Front. Always viewed as a \"moderate\" when it came to the question of a Revolution and an active supporter of the concept of Greater Romania, it is no surprise that he ended up supporting the Alba Iulia assembly during the War of Union, together with like-minded socialists, like Gheorghe Gregorovici or Iosif Jumanca. In fact, this support earned him a prison sentence in 1922, which lasted until the General Amnesty of 1930. Soon after, he became active in Politics once more, with the memories of his support of the Assembly still present in the backs of officials' heads, and began forming a faction around the same things he supported earlier. In 1935 he came into contact with the so-called \"White Eagles\" and became one of the people responsible for their eventual inclusion in the structures of the state as a means of gaining support against Foris, with the end goal being eliminating the potential threat they can pose soon after."
POLITICS_STELESCU_DESC:0 "If you were to say Mihai Stelescu's name out loud in Iasi or Bucharest, chances are you might get shot on the spot. The infamous, now former, legionnaire has almost singlehandedly shaped Romania's politics with the 1930 coup attempt in Romania, right after King Ferdinand I's death. The failure has led to the Legion being exiled to Moldova and adopting an entirely new strategy, and Stelescu over the years began losing influence in the movement, until in 1933 he felt the pressure was too much and split off from the Legion, forming the \"White Eagles\" and being quickly forced into exile yet again, this time settling in Transylvania, where he met the famous writer, Panait Istrati. Istrati, disillusioned with Leninism, began searching for something new, and when he found the new movement, he decided to join it, becoming a large influence in their current, socialist-aligned views. Now, the Eagles have taken charge, and are aiming as high as ever."

#IDEAS#
TRS_hungarian_benefactors:0 "Hungarian Benefactors"
TRS_hungarian_benefactors_desc:0 "The Socialist Republic, although very autonomous, is closely linked to the Hungarian Council Republic, with the government constantly pulling itself closer to Hungary. This has led to major Hungarian influence in the economy - something very much appreciated by the government in Budapest."
TRS_red_romanian_idea:0 "The Red Romania Idea"
TRS_red_romanian_idea_desc:0 "Transylvania, in order to survive, must adapt. If the Revolutionary Government is to hold, we must anticipate a strike from the governments in Wallachia and Moldova and unite Romania under our banner."
TRS_white_eagles:0 "The White Eagles"
TRS_white_eagles_desc:0 "\"The White Eagles\" is a name given to Mihai Stelescu and Panait Istrati's group. Strongly nationalist, oriented against the Internationale, with socialist economic ideas, the group appeals to a very specific demographic, but nonetheless hopes to dominate the political scene."
