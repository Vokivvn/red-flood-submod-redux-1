ALB_house_of_slavery:0 "The House of Slavery"
ALB_house_of_slavery_desc:0 "Following the Independence of Albania in 1912 and the establishment of Central and Provisional Albania and in the wake of the Balkan War, the Great Powers of the world looked to unite the Albanian peoples in the face of potential further conflict. Thus, when time came to proclaim the ruler of Albania, Aladro Kastrioti, a Spanish nobleman and Albanian nationalist, was crowned as King Skënderbeu II. However, with his death in 1914 leaving no heir, the Prime Minister Essad Pasha took the opportunity to block the crowning of a new king, instead aligning Albania with the Ottoman Empire and the Young Turks.\n\nOnce the war had ended and the Ottoman lands dismembered by Britain, the question came of what to do with Albania. In a move widely criticized, the British handed the throne to King Fuad of Egypt due to his Albanian heritage — as well as legitimizing an imperial expansion — crowning him as King Skënderbeu III. After this, many Albanians began to reject monarchist visions, fueling the ranks of both Balli Kombëtar and Parti Islamike of Enver Hoxha, Republican movements preaching bold words of taking arms against the puppet Pharaoh."
ALB_voice_of_napoleon:0 "The Voice of Napoleon"
ALB_voice_of_napoleon_desc:0 "When Fuad was crowned, some clans rejected the British pawn, citing the fact he was selected not by the Albanian people, but by Essad Pasha. Roland Napoléon Bonaparte, exile King and successor to Skënderbeu II, has been waging a Loyalist campaign from his seat in Italy. Together with his daughter, Princess Marie of Greece and Denmark, the two have diplomatically isolated Fuad's regime, cutting Tirana's ties with Rome and Athens, and while Roland's frequent speeches on the radio have helped, the grip that Fuad holds over Albania prevents his return. For now, he has carved out a loud niche forced to wait for the right occasion, but if the stars align, Roland will take every measure to regain his throne— even if it would mean contacting the devil Artaud who reigns in his solar lair."
ALB_voice_of_napoleon2:0 "The Voice of Napoleon"
ALB_voice_of_napoleon2_desc:0 "Through the purest of will, Roland Bonaparte has struck down Republicans and Baron Nopcsa alike, yet in his grace has forgiven both sides and allowed them to exist under his benevolent hand. Now, as his ancestor once before him, he has begun to focus on creating a strong, independent country as King of the Albanians. Yet this exact ancestral issue leads some observers to worry that the newly-crowned Skënderbeu IV shall follow in the footsteps of his ancestor, forging his imperial ambitions in the Balkans. For now, this kind of voice is laughed at, as both opponents and supporters of Roland see him as a rather moderate kind of ruler who cares more about stabilizing and securing the throne than carving an empire in the spirit of emulation."
ALB_eccentric_escapade:0 "An Eccentric Escapade"
ALB_eccentric_escapade_desc:0 "Even without his legs, Baron Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás has failed to break under the pressure of his enemies. With his loyal comrades and his husband Bajazid Doda, the Baron has defeated both Bonapartists and Republicans, securing his position as the newly crowned King of Albania. Skënderbeu IV continues the legacy of his predecessor and close friend Fuad, introducing Albania to the wonders of Enlightened Absolutism. Yet the Baron has not simply spent his newly acquired power and funds on his own pleasures; rather, he has funded universities and studies across Albania, as well as fueling museums with various exhibits to stimulate the economy. With connections to the British and a handshake with the west, Albania under Nopcsa rule shall slowly become not a backward agrarian country, but a pearl of the Mediterranean that will shine bright for centuries to come."
ALB_one_national_front:0 "One National Front"
ALB_one_national_front_desc:0 "After a long fight, the Albanian people can finally choose their destiny for themselves. Balli Kombëtar has led a front of peasants, nationalists, and even Islamic clergy in a push against the last remnants of royalists; Fuad, Bonapartist, and Nopcsa have all been defeated with ease, and a secular, socialist republic has been established. Some, however, are afraid that Balli will not be so different from the people they swore to defeat, as all political forces both right and left are forbidden to challenge the new regime. With even the clergy backing the party, nothing stands in the way of Mid'hat Frashëri from establishing his dreams of a free and independent Albania - democratic or not."
ALB_supreme_guidance:0 "Supreme Guidance from the Supreme Leader"
ALB_supreme_guidance_desc:0 "After Kreyziu and his dogs stormed Tirana, many lived in constant fear of Yugoslav bandits turning their country into a living hell. But then, a mighty hero, the sword of Allah, slew the servants of Great Shaitan. Together with remnants of Balli Kombëtar, Enver Hoxha has defeated the Yugoslav mongrels and secured Albanian independence once more. Now Albania is under the rule not of a foreign monarch, but rather a pious patriot and servant of the greater truth. Hoxha has become the Supreme Leader not only of the Bektashi Order but of all Albanians, establishing the Islamic Republic of Rumelia with himself at the helm. Already, contacts have been established with the friendly Ottoman government, yet the new government knows well that it will not be enough to scare away Yugoslavia. Therefore, Supreme Leader Hoxha has ordered a project of a massive network of forts across the newly created Republic, so any invader shall be unable to put the Albanian people to the blade. Rumelia is united by faith, strength, and by the guidance of the Supreme Leader; ready to bite like a venomous snake anyone who dares to attack."
ALB_welcome_gentlemen_YUG:0 "Welcome to Albania, Gentlemen"
ALB_welcome_gentlemen_YUG_desc:0 "The word "Albania" has become obsolete, a mere flash of the past as Yugoslav soldiers march through Tirana. Now Albania — or Illyria as it is known now — has become a part of the greater Yugoslav nation, free of tribalistic borders. At least, that is how it looks on paper. In reality, as the new governor of the Autonomous Region of Illyria, Ceno Kreyziu and his brother-in-law Ahmet Zogoli have made Illyria into a constant warzone, a black market hotspot in Europe, and their private money laundering scheme. Many young Yugoslavs arrived in Illyria aiming to find glory and adventure, plundering everything that glimmers or shines. Many of them become mere mercenaries no different from Hajduks, or partisans who are fighting the plutocratic rule of Kreyziu. Yet the loudest sound of all is the roar of autogyros, continually arriving from Yugoslavia to secure their rule. The chances of survival in Illyria? Small. But what is worth more than the greatest prize of all— gold?"
