#LEADER DESCRIPTIONS
KOR_SETTING_SUN_DESC:0 "Korea is the jewel of the Japanese Empire, it is subject to severe colonial policies and attempts at industrialisation. This has not come without sacrifice however, Korean independence activity has been growing since the Man-se Demonstrations of 1919. Now with the activists in Korea itself and the GMD-affiliated partisans in China and Manchuria, Japan's grip on Korea is threatened."

POLITICS_Ugaki_Kazushige_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_RHEE_DESC:0 "Mr. Rhee is one of the veterans of the Korean Nationalist movement, he has spent most of his adult life campaigning for it, having built strong ties in America and China to do so. But he is by far one of the most conservative and ruthless of the movement's leaders, leading to his ostracisation by most forward-thinking, moderate and leftist elements. He still keeps the company of the national conservatives, but the influence of Ahn Changho is beginning to outstrip his own."

POLITICS_AHN_DESC:0 "Mr. Ahn is a well educated Korean-American christian and notable figure in the Korean independence movement. One-time president of the provisional government-in-exile, his educated background and connections in America have made him a formidable political leader in the struggle to liberate Korea."

POLITICS_KOO_DESC:0 "Kim Koo, also known as \"Baekbeom\" has made the independence of a Korean Republic his mission in life, and has stood as vice president of the republic-in-exile for years. One of the leaders of the Donghak Movement and a prominent figure among Korean independence acitivsts since the March 1st Movement, his long career has brought him the respect of his peers in the patriotic groups. His ardent anti-communist stance makes him a polarising figure to some in the fatherland, but his position is also considered too soft by the likes of Syngman Rhee."

POLITICS_YUH_DESC:0 "Yuh Woon-hyung may come from a well-to-do family, but he has been a force for popular democratic left-wing nationalism among Korean independence activists for years. A true believer in the spirit of self-determination and co-operation, he is one of the few in the Korean Republic who do not see the more radical leftist elements in the North as enemies, rather as brothers in the same struggle to unite Korea. Though in the end, he may not get his way, as war between the two sides is highly likely regardless of his soothing words of brotherhood."

POLITICS_CHOE_DESC:0 "Cho Chang-ik is among the younger political leaders of the Korean Revolution, having been a student at the time of the March 1st Movement. Now, he has become a prominent voice among left-wing circles of the Korean Independence Movement."

POLITICS_CHO_DESC:0 "Mr. Cho commands a great deal of respect among leftists in the Korean Independence Movement. He was arrested in the March 1st crackdowns by the Japanese, but went on to become an important figure in organising people's committees and promoting agricultural programs of self-sufficiency. While his Christian faith is a problem for some among the Korean socialists, he remains an important figure, crucial to the success of a socialist Korea."

POLITICS_KIM_DESC:0 "While the concept of an anarchist leader is somewhat oxymoronic, Kim Chwa-chin has become something of a figurehead for the anarchist partisans from the Korean parts of South-East Manchuria. His arrival in Korea for the revolution signals a shift in intent, having tested the means and methods of Korean anarchism in the countryside borderlands between Mantetsu and Zheltorossiya, the Korean anarchist faction is now a leading component of the revolutionary political scene. Kim has been repeatedly voted as the chairman of the council, making him now the most experienced statesman among them."

POLITICS_PAK_DESC:0 "Pak Hon-yong is seemingly ever-present where the Korean socialist cause is concerned, he has made it his business to be involved in any and all activities that may lead to a communist Korea, right down to helping to organise the Worker's Party in 1925. Despite his relative youth among his peers, he is a senior leader and well read on the German Revolution, having even spent time abroad among Chinese communists during the late 20's. During the early 1930's he has made himself busy with clandestine meetings, arangements and deal brokering between the various socialist movements in Korea, in an attempt to build a coalition that can pose a serious threat to Japanese rule in Korea."

POLITICS_SIN_DESC:0 "For a time in the 1910s and 20s, Sin Chaeho was a darling of Korean nationalist organisations. He advocated for the Korean national and ethnic people viscerally, but this fervour brought him under the close watch of the Japanese authorities. He exiled himself to Manchuria, co-operating with Korean anarchists in the region and formulating his writings into a cogent ideological viewpoint. Today, his ideology is known as Juche, his program of national rebirth and ethnic nationalism under a kind of anarcho-syndicalism has become one of the more popular ideologies in Northern Korea. However, in order to enact his program he must first over come the internal differences in Korea and then the occupying powers in Manchuria. He is by far the most ambitious of Korea's revolutionary leaders, and perhaps the most dangerous too, the bounty on his head is considerable even to this day."

kor.1.t:0 "Korean Nobility Under Siege"
kor.1.d:0 "As the Korean republic is born at last, the Korean nobility have found themselves between a rock and a hard place. The revolutionaries in the North call for their blood, the Japanese seek their replacement by nobles of their own and the republic seeks to strip them of their titles. Of all the choices the republic at least is promising them safety, the Japanese, whie sympathetic with their own troubles at home, can hardly be considered reliable friends, especially with rumours abound of Japanese pogroms against Koreans occuring in the countryside."
kor.1.a:0 "The old ways are dying off."

kor.2.t:0 "Making the best of the worst"
kor.2.d:0 "It could not possibly be clearer to anyone that the era of Japanese imperialism is nearing its end, or at least its crescendo. Ever since the March 1st incident of 1919, the grip of the Japanese on Korea has severely weakened, and resistance to occupation has been ramping up in the last four years. The prevailing belief in Japan is that Japan must either cede to the demands of the Koreans, or brace for colonial revolt. This is obviously the worst-case scenario, seeing as republican, socialist, and anarchist movements are alive and well in China and Manchuria, and would surely take such an opportunity to strike against our government in Manchuria, aided by Chinese nationalists as well as the Zhili clique.\nAll of the struggles of Japan's foreign policy have thrown Japan's domestic politics completely out of balance, to the point of turning Japan from an up-and-coming empire into a crippled nation ripe for Communist revolution. As Japan careens into an uncertain era, it is up to the colonial government to try and steer the Korea as best it can in the right direction, and it is up to the Revolutionaries and Republicans to find a way to unify so that they may finally end the Sick Man of Asia's grip on their country."
kor.2.a:0 "We shall weather the coming storm."
kor.2.b:0 "May the lightning strike down the tyrants."

kor.3.t:0 "Experimenting with Egalitarianism"
kor.3.d:0 "As Japanese Imperial Korea approaches total collapse, the Japanese government has been forced to consider the impossible, the unthinkable, the unbelievable: extending civil rights to women in the peninsula. While women in Japan are not exactly equal with their male counterparts in the eyes of the law, the position of Korean women is even less so. Korean women are often assigned to Japanese soldiers as "comfort women", which is basically a form of involuntary prostitution. This has become the main focus of the women's rights debate, as even the most chauvinistic among the Japanese ruling class have come to see this system as somewhat brutal. Another issue which is emerging from the Diet's more progressive members is allowing women into the workforce. While this idea is strongly opposed by the vast majority of those who believe in Japanese traditional society, the idea of doubling the workforce in both Korea and Japan, effectively doubling industrial productivity, is attractive on a practical level. All that remains is to see what the Diet decides…"
kor.3.a:0 "Ridiculous! Any other bright ideas?"
kor.3.b:0 "Perhaps we could at least stop the sex slavery…"
kor.3.c:0 "Try it here first, the home islands later."

kor.4.t:0 "Korean Cultural Preservation"
kor.4.d:0 "As is the case in most colonial empires, one of the biggest problems that colonised nations face is the erasure of their native culture by their overlord. This is precisely why Prince Yi Wu has decided to pre-empt the erasure of his culture, and by extension his claim to the throne of Korea, by petitioning the Japanese government to ensure that Korean culture is safeguarded by a new Cultural Preservation Program in the peninsula. Korea has already been affected by Japanese cultural imperialism to some degree, with mass proliferation of Japanese language texts in Korea, as well as all official documents being printed in Japanese. However, the relatively weak presence of the Japanese in Korea seems to have all but halted the process of Nihonisation, at least for now. Regardless, the Korean Prince still sees the looming threat of Korean destruction as one to be taken seriously, and is not backing down on this issue. The Korean exiles in other nations, such as Republicans in China and even the Anarchists and Communists in Manchuria, have praised Prince Yi's stalwart defense of his nation, even under the boot of imperialism. Most of the native population, on the other hand, has been silent, either out of disinterest in high-minded politics or a fear of retribution from Japanese authorities. Japan is now left with a decision to make; give their subjects what they want, or face the potentially revolutionary consequences."
kor.4.a:0 "I can't understand him anyway."
kor.4.b:0 "Very well, set up the program."

kor.5.t:0 "Extend the Industrial Quotas"
kor.5.d:0 "Yet again, an issue whose discussion was meant to be a formality with a predetermined conclusion has raised hell amongst the Japanese Diet. This week's screaming match is over Japan's plans for Korean industrialization. On one hand, the Korean economy is in poor shape. Much of the country is still very rural, with many Korean farmers still having not moved beyond subsistence agriculture. On the other, however, the present colonial status quo has already uprooted the lives of many Koreans, and they would surely not respond well to more aggressive policies. Although many politicians are dedicated to defending their positions and ideals, many burned out ministers are simply desperate for some kind of consensus and an end to the constant bickering. After much feuding and mud-slinging, the Japanese Diet has finally agreed…"
kor.5.a:0 "Double the quotas."
kor.5.b:0 "Maintain current policies."
kor.5.c:0 "Roll back progress, the risk of famine is too high."

kor.6.t:0 "Land Ownership Issue"
kor.6.d:0 "Since the colonization of Korea in 1910, land ownership has been a thorny issue. Initial efforts to disposes the Koreans backfired with nationalist movements and rebellious nobles. The policy was mostly dropped until the rule of Hirohito signalled a major change, as Japanese colonists gained high preference in land rights, creating a strong class divide between the landowning Japanese and the peasant farmers of Korea. However, some of these peasant farmers have been fortunate enough to accumulate their own wealth, and now seek to become landowners themselves. The government in Korea is deeply opposed to this idea, given that a vast majority of politicians in Korea are Japanese landowners themselves. However, as the ties between Japan and the crown jewel of her empire become more and more frayed, it is being increasingly seen as an alternative to outright Korean revolt. There is no doubt among the ruling government that the Koreans are almost unanimous in their support of this legislation, and to block it would alienate the entirety of the colony's native population. However, some of the more hardline aristocrats see the risk as worth taking, if it means defending the status quo that they have worked so hard to maintain for the past two and a half decades. After much debate over the pragmatism of avoiding open rebellion versus the idealist principles of the colonists, the government has finally decided…"
kor.6.a:0 "To veto the Land Reform Bill."
kor.6.b:0 "To pass the Land Reform Bill."

kor.7.t:0 "Japanese Diet Debates Korean Migration Policy"
kor.7.d:0 "Today was supposed to be a rather routine day for the Japanese Imperial Diet, discussing their foreign affairs policies going forward, which were supposed to remain largely the same. However, an uproar began when the issue of migration to the Korean peninsula was brought up, with those favoring de-escalation of colonization policies hurling insults at those who thought it time to double the Japanese settlement efforts. The opposition has rationalized that increasing migration to Korea will be seen as an aggressive move by the native population, who will turn against their overlords even more than they already have. However, those in favor argue that Korea's issue is not with dissatisfaction, but uncivilization. By observing the examples of noble Japanese colonists, the Korean people would learn to respect their betters and mind themselves. After seemingly endless debating and mud-slinging, the bickering Diet members managed to conclude that…"
kor.7.a:0 "Increase Nihonisation."
kor.7.b:0 "Slow down before something bad happens."
kor.7.c:0 "Maintain current levels of migration."

kor.100.t:0 "The Resistance Intensifies"
kor.100.d:0 "With news of Japan's misfortunes spreading throughout the empire, many brazen acts of insurrection have taken place in major cities across Korea. Soldiers have already engaged Korean partisans in the North and the Garrisons in Keijo are pleading Pusan for help with riots. Things are quickly spiralling out of control..."
kor.100.a:0 "Oh No."

kor.101.t:0 "Korean Revolution"
kor.101.d:0 "A declaration is made on the radio, then by telegram, then in print. 'The Korean Republic is born today' A rally cry from Seoul to all loyal sons and daughters of the country to take up arms and fight for their freedom. Reports of Japanese officials committing seppuku scarcely have chance to reach Ugaki's desk before a second declaration comes through, this time from partisan fighters in Shirotsu, 'The Korean People's Republic' has declared its independence from Japan and has started its glorious revolution for the people. With a hastily annotated map adorning the Officers table, Ugaki begins to plot the downfall of these upstarts. But his forces are stretched thin, with few soldiers and fewer friends, the Korean Civil War begins."
kor.101.a:0 "Found the Republic."
kor.101.b:0 "Stay Loyal to the Empire."
kor.101.c:0 "Join the Partisans."

kor.8.t:0 "Anarchist Militias Join the Cause"
kor.8.d:0 "The Korean People's Association in Manchuria is a somewhat obscure Anarchist project which has set up an autonomous zone in the province of Mudanjiang as a sort of base of operations for their actions in Korea proper. Although they have so far not been able to affect much change, the outbreak of a civil war has afforded these radicals with an indispensable opportunity. There is now a coalition in Korea itself which seeks to establish socialism and fights against the Imperial Loyalists in the North and is sizing up their rival republicans in the South. These radical republicans consist of communists, socialists, as well as fellow anarchists who have allied together in the hopes of finding a place for themselves in the new revolutionary era. The KPAM has enthusiastically committed to sending their militias to assist the communist-led forces, but some wonder whether this is truly a wise decision, as history has shown that Marxists and Anarchists do not always tend to find much common ground. Some, on the other hand, are suggesting that this is the beginning of the true anarchist revolution for which they have been waiting, and have called to disband the KPAM in order to totally commit to this conflict. It is unclear what the majority opinion is, but it seems the KPAM is here to stay, for now at least."
kor.8.a:0 "Take up arms for freedom!"

kor.9.t:0 "Subvert The Russians"
kor.9.d:0 "The Russians have been presecuting and deporting our brothers from Manchuria for decades. It is time we reclaimed the land of our fore-bears, drive out the slavic barbarians. First a rally to the persecuted, then while they deal with the inner turmoil, we invade. Drive them back to the Amur river and make our people whole again."
kor.9.a:0 "Drive back the European invaders."

kor.10.t:0 "United Republic"
kor.10.d:0 "After much deliberation and consternation, a power sharing deal has been agreed. The Governments of the North and South will become one. Our differences put aside, our brothers reunited. Korea stands as one, stronger together once and for all."
kor.10.a:0 "At last!"

kor.11.t:0 "Request Ships"
kor.11.d:0 "In order to safeguard the Korean coastline we need ships, a request put to our comrades in Japan could yield results, after all, they commandeered much of the IJN. Surely Shumei's sailors can spare a few destoryers?"
kor.11.a:0 "They probably don't have the fuel for them all."

kor.111.t:0 "The Korean's Request Ships"
kor.111.d:0 "The Revolution in Korea is a promising development, their leadership have reached out to us about a purchase of 4 destroyers to defend their coast and facilitate coastal bombardment against their counter-revolutionary foes."
kor.111.a:0 "Naturally, we shall send them aid."
kor.111.b:0 "We cannot spare any ships, but we can send some of our officers as advisors."

kor.12.t:0 "Request Guns"
kor.12.d:0 "The Russian Republic's modest army is rather well equipped, that is, relatively. Since our need is great and they have the industry to support it, we should request a shippment of arms from them to bolster our troops."
kor.12.a:0 "They'll be put to good use."

kor.13.t:0 "Request Advisors"
kor.13.d:0 "The Russian Republic watches our progress intently, their military expertise from the civil war is still valuable insight in these dark times for our people. A request for military training and advice would be prudent."
kor.13.a:0 "Their assistance is appreciated."

kor.14.t:0 "Seek Backing From The Russians"
kor.14.d:0 "Since the Russian Republic is one of the few regimes in the region friendly to our cause, we should seek their doctrinal, material and logistical aid against the counter-revolutionary forces. First things first the repatriation of Korean leftists on their turf should bring us a boon of men and expertise."
kor.14.a:0 "Supporting foreign insurgencies has never backfired."

kor.15.t:0 "Co-operation with the Left-GMD"
kor.15.d:0 "The Left-Guomindang has been most hospitable to our leaders in their exile. Since they have continued to offer us support in return for help in future, we should increase our level of diplomatic co-operation and establish formal ties."
kor.15.a:0 "We share the same struggle."

kor.16.t:0 "Imperial Family Flees to Korea"
kor.16.d:0 "With Revolutionary forces quickly overtaking the country, and the fall of the capital, the Imperial family has seen fit to flee the country to escape persecution at the hands of socialist forces. The former dominion of Korea has welcomed them, they landed in Pusan aboard an unmarked plane in the early hours of the day. Not only do the family seek to preserve their lives, but to also form an imperial government in exile to oppose the revolution which has bloodily seized Japan."
kor.16.a:0 "Catch them if you can."

kor.17.t:0 "Revive The Minjok"
kor.17.d:0 "The national spirit of our people must be reborn, our subjugation to the Japanese and Chinese must end once and for all. Our people are our own, we are no slaves, subjects or inferor people, we are proud Koreans!"
kor.17.a:0 "Our Nation, Our People!"

kor.171.t:0 "A New Order of Knights"
kor.171.d:0 "In ancient times, Korea called upon brave and noble horsemen known as Flower Knights or Hwarang. Not just mere soldiers, they were artists, scholars and pious Buddhist learners. Made strong and fair with their dress, training and impeccable conduct. In order to properly revive the Minjok and reforge Korean culture for the new age, the Flower Knights shall return, the pinacle of Korean culture and martial prowess. They will bring Juche to all Koreans and defend it from the impure outsiders."
kor.171.a:0 "The Gukseon (Grand Master) is the ideal Knight of Juche!"

kor.172.t:0 "Juche and Religion"
kor.172.d:0 "While the doctrine of Juche is a righteous program of national renewal, pride of people and continual reinvention, it is not a panacea. A key component of reviving Korea's soul is Korean Buddhism and Shamanic culture, by propagandising the people and funding the restoration of many temples, the renaissance of Korean Buddhism can begin in full. Naturally, this campaign must appeal to the people's popular sentiments, by injecting the ubiquitous Taegeuk symbol into our messaging, we can promote Buddhism and reigious scholarship to the people as a demonstration of national and ethnic pride, in line with Juche's ideals; rather than the dangerous nature of reactionary Goryeo era submissiveness, which led to the embarassing Joseon period.\nWe must be cautious however, to characterise this as Korean movement, any dreaded Chinese, Tibetan or Mongol influence would be unacceptable according to Sin's teachings. As the old orders had revered masters, the new Buddhism will know only one master and it's name is Juche."
kor.172.a:0 "The people's spirit is rekindled."

kor.173.t:0 "Finno-Korean Summit"
kor.173.d:0 "Despite apparent large differences in platform, ideology and culture, Finland and Korea have developed amicable relations lately. Both stand almost alone, surrounded by much more powerful and belligerent neighbours that have subjected their people to evils in their recent past. The first round of what is to be four major summits establishing Finno-Korean friendship has taken place in Pyongyang. The summits will discuss further diplomatic and economic co-operation between the two nations. Throughout history both peoples have reached highs never yet matched, perhaps together they can surpass their forebears as brothers."

kor.174.a:0 "Blessed leaders, unlikely friends."

kor.175.t:0 "Finno-Korean War"
kor.175.d:0 "In ancient myth there are tales of a war that shaped Northern Eurasia. A war that was to be the demise of an ancient Korean civilisation, and an ancient Finnic civilisation. The notion is scoffed at by historians, but among those who know the folklore it is a cautionary tale. This tale it seems has not had its message heard, as now thousands, maybe millions more will perish as they did in the old days. May the spirits forgive us."
kor.175.a:0 "Truly a clash of civilisations."

kor.18.t:0 "The Agrarian Faction"
kor.18.d:0 "The Agrarian Socialists make up a large portion of the People's Party base, frayed loyalties and percieved failings to the peasants have resulted in a belligerent fracture in among the communists widening into a full blown internal power struggle."
kor.18.a:0 "Eject them from Government."
kor.18.b:0 "Embrace Cho's faction."

kor.19.t:0 "Leftist Groups Suppressed"
kor.19.d:0 "Through covert operations, divide and conquer tactics and good old fashioned propaganda, we have broken the cohesion of most leftist political groups. The threat they posed to our stability is now all but gone, now Korea will have a chance at striking forward into its glorious future free from mob tyranny and Pan-Asianist treachery."
kor.19.a:0 "And stay down."

kor.20.t:0 "The Revolutionary Coalition"
kor.20.d:0 "The Korean Revolutionaries may have secured their collective position, but the internal differences between the various groups remains stark. The leading Vanguardist People's Party are at hard odds with the Nationalist Revolution and Anarcho-Communists, in order to settle the internal disagreements without bloodshed, a series of congressional votes and plebicites have been organised. The division of the parties looks to be unbreakable, but if the coalition breaks with one of the three main partners, a strong basis for rule could be established."
kor.20.a:0 "Stick with the Worker's Party."
kor.20.b:0 "The National Revolution will guide the people."

Sin Chaeho's National Revolution party originally failed to secure a majority, but after negotiations with Pak and Chwa-Chin, they will form a coalition government. their rhetoric about building a new and better Korea through radical and highly unusual policies enticed many..

kor.203.d:0 "After a tense voting period following the turmoil of the revolution, a clear winner of the election has emerged. Kim Chwa-Chin's anarcho-communes have secured a safe majority, their libertarian rhetoric about self-governing communes, union representation for all and broad civil and economic liberties enticed many to vote for him. With the election won, he will make a speech in the capital later today about what will be done in the coming times."

kor.21.d:0 "As dawn broke, there was a clatter of gunfire, no 21 gun salute, not the scatter-shot of battle. No, that was the synchronised, rythmic crack of a firing squad. It seemed to go on for some time. Eventually the barking of the staff-sergeant could be heard telling the men to stand down. By then the sun was up, the tea was going cold and the bodies of dead prisoners were beginning to attract flies. The trucks hauled them away, but the sensation that something heinous had just been committed was still hanging in the air like mist. \"Did I really have to do that?\""

But since they no longer patrolled his halls, waiting on his beck and call, he couldn't picture them correctly. They had betrayed him, that was the line. Traitors. But perhaps he had acted rashly. Did they really deserve the bullet? Another missive had arrived on his desk as he stared off into space, another list with another familiar name on it. Surely not him as well?

Ryoshi slid the door open and came inside as though he preferred not to make a noise. Peculiar, thought Ugaki, normally Ryoshi wouldn't be so sheepish. The young man paced forward, bowed and then came to Ugaki's side, he whispered in his ear while passing him an un-addressed letter. The seal was that of the Emperor, though a bit rougher than usual; the wax was cracked and the seal itself uneven, as though it had been made by a most shaky hand. Ugaki unsealed the letter and withdrew the paper, he glanced at Ryoshi before reading, measuring his response, he seemed unfazed. 'Honourable Governor-General' -the letter began - 'Your tireless duty to the Empire has not gone unnoticed in this trying time, by the will of the Emperor you are hereby appointed as his prime-minister-in-absentia. Your first issued command is to offer punishment as you see fit upon the traitors to the Empire, be they of noble Japanese or peasant Korean blood, all traitors must be punished. The punishment should continue until resistance is no more.' Ugaki paused before turning back to Ryoshi."

kor.27.d:0 "Despite thousands of imprisonments, hours upon hours of torture and confessions, hundreds of executions and a few prisoner 'suicides', Ugaki's mandated punishments have yet to bear any fruit. His subordinates begin to wonder why the garrisons should bother rounding up so-called dissenters at all when nothing seems to come of it. Resistance in the country is still rampant, the partisans cross between Manchuria and Korea with seeming impunity and the army cannot contain them all, let alone the amateur terror attacks in major cities against Japanese citizens and soldiers."

Two divisions of Japanese troops had attempted to ambush a column of Korean guerillas in the eastern hills, when a counter-trap was sprung. One side weary and lacking sleep, the other short of training and ammunition. The ensuing fight was bloodier than any to that point, with machine guns and rifles running dry in mere hours, much of the fighting devolved into a quagmire of katanas, clubs, pistols and mud. Eventually the army gained an upper hand of sorts - the artillery batteries from one of the other divisions came into range before the infantry could arrive - shells began to rain on the Korean lines of approach, though it was not certain excatly where they were. Stray shells peppered the remaining combatants along the 'frontlines' (chiefly foxholes and grenade craters). After more than a day of fighting the Army cleared the area and the Koreans retreated. Ugaki came out to inspect the battlefield and decorate his troops in a rare public showing. The cleanup had barely begun when he arrived and the stench of death hung in the air like a fog. The Japanese troops would naturally all recieve full funerals and honours - at least those with bodies to be found - the issue of the partisans however was a final chance to send a message to the rebels."

While policy would gridlock under such an order, a non-party voting system among the councils allows for issues that supercede a council's jurisdiction to be approved or denied by popularity among the representatives.
