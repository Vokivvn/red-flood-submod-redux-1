#Brief history
KCK_DESC_MENU:0 "Yakutia's place in the Russian Empire has always been that of the forgotten backwater. A land of forests, prisons and bitter cold. Grigory Stark's loyalty to Petrograd has been a topic of some contention since his ascendency in 1925, but as Russia marches on in spite of its weakness, Stark's position looks to be the least of Petrograd's worries. Should the Republicans to the South or the seditious elements of the Far-East succeed, Yakutia could well become a frozen bulwark against the Tsarist rule."

In 1936, another opportunity came, yet that ended up vanquished too. And now? The fourth incarnation of Sakha is here, weaker than ever, even if it will outlast all the others. The murder of Pavel Ksenofontov and his compatriots has been one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century, one for which all Sakha have paid so dearly. What good is our natural resilience in the face of lacking manpower and professional cadres? There are things folk wisdom just cannot build. Our dream, although realized, is just a shell. Despite peace, tough times are coming for our state, and we must ask ourselves - will the blood of a Sakha persevere through this?"

kck.1.desc:0 "It was another freezing day all across the rump Far-Eastern Governorate-General, as new investors come in through the port of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and arrive in Yakutsk to discuss business. People played in the streets, some sang, some sold things. Things appeared good, until it seemed something was wrong. Very wrong. The Yakut workers across Yakutsk began to stop working; it almost felt like a subconscious movement that spanned every Yakut and other opressed group within the Governorate. But it was not subconscious; they had been planning this revolt for months, and it seemed like the most likely to succeed. Regardless, if it did not, dying for the dream of a free Yakutia is better than living under Russia, in the eyes of many. As this strike occured, it appeared that thousands of Yakuts began marching towards Yakutsk, the capital of the Governorate, and proclaimed in Russian and Yakut \"No more!\", resulting in massive, brutal response by the local police. However, the Yakuts, with their fighting and hunting experience, began to force the Russian police away from them. As they continued to march on the capital of Yakutsk, more reinforcements arrived from the northern areas, as more Russian officers came to the aid of their policemen. This revolt wasn't like the others. Regardless, the Yakut National Congress began to speak in front of a podium a few streets across from the Capital Building, and proclaimed that Yakutia would become a free nation opposed to Russian imperialism. Ksenofontov, aware of what is going on, quickly gets to work in keeping the act of neutrality, whilst Russian officers continue to attack violently against the Yakuts. Eventually, one group manages to win out, when..."

The dream of a democratic and free future for all Yakutians would be born here. With a delegation of 2431 members, 1302 of whom being from local non-Slavic groups such as the Tungids. However, the rest of the groups are mostly Russians, Ukrainians, Jews, etc. who were either forcibly settled or settled for opportunity. There is also one Permanent Japanese, American, and British delegate in the Constitution, a move considered controversial. Regardless, the constitutional convention continued as usual, with Ksenofontov leading the efforts to secure democratic policies and ensuring a balance between the Tungus peoples and the Slavs, alongside encouraging American and British investors to strengthen Yakutia's economy as a resource powerhouse. After 14 long hours of discussion, the Republic of Yakutia's constitution had been created, a land made for all to come and live freely, a land of true liberty and idealism."

kck.4.desc:0 "Kurihara was tired. He, depressed and anxious, afraid of military service, and scared of the expectations placed on him, was sick of being poor in every facet of life. He wanted opportunity. One day he was drinking sake and looking outside his home in Nagasaki, when he kept researching across Japan for ways to avoid military service, which in his eyes would ruin his already fragile emotional and mental state. So, he began to develop connections. Psychologists, military-experienced people, all kinds of people as he began to get the latest news in Japanese politics. Then, he heard of an excursion of 200 Japanese officers to Yakuti... Yakutia? What are they doing in Russia again? \n \"Last time this happened, it didn't go well for us\", he thought. Yet, it felt like opportunity. He kept an eye on it. After a couple of weeks, he'd heard that the Japanese officers had successfully declared the independence of the Yakut people. This meant that it was, as he knew, a client state of Japan. It still didn't feel like enough to be a possible evasion; his dread increased. Yet, he'd heard of gold and other resources' mining in the area. Knowing this would be a good chance to work for the Government, Kurihara began to look into migration possibilities as an investor. Then, he began hearing of more stories, so many stories of people finding immense amounts of gold in undeveloped areas; it felt like he, himself, had struck gold in many ways. He began to pack his things, stopped paying rent, and went to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, slowly driving by taxi towards Okhotsk, and so, he began his ultimate attempt at success in life. He was there early, there weren't many Japanese mining in the area, but enough to have caused news in the homeland. He began to work as an independent miner, officially a \"Assistance Development Team Member\", finding immense quantities of gold never touched by man before. And like that, in the golden rocks of Yakutia, he found peace and wealth."

Several generals suggest that we look into mobility as a key factor in our Army, to counter the severe desolation of our territory. A few others claim that we should focus instead on artillery static positions and avoid moving intensely during battle, resulting in a better planned out attack. A few other officers agree, but a disagreement they have is with the focus on Artillery, instead preferring trenches and infantry."

Whilst many of our planes are old, there a great few pilots with immense ambition that have come to talk with us regarding the future of Yakutian aviation. The first group suggests that we should focus on strategic bombing, as it might be increasingly difficult to protect our airspace and subsequently might be better to focus on destroying the enemy. The second group disagrees, and believes that CAS airplanes should protect our soldiers and territory with great force, and focus our industry in such. The last group believes that our airplanes should be at the highest of quality possible, and subsequently suggest that we should focus on smaller, better quantities of planes intended for anti-CAS operations."

The largest group wishes to focus as many resources as possible into Naval matters, and subsequently create a large, unbeatable navy that will protect the Sea of Okhotsk from our enemies. A smaller group, but still prominent, suggests that we should focus entirely on closing trade barriers around the advantageous position we have, and subsequently protect allied trade. The smallest but most ambitious group suggests that we focus on ambitious warfare involving naval invasions, and subsequently look into defending our convoys with Submarines."

You can have all your social programs, all your flags, all your congresses, all your decorum. As long as you host our fleet during the ongoing troubles in our homeland, and as long as you continue to support the Emperor with resources after the civil war, we will be perfectly fine with you. Fail that, and you will be removed and a more friendly leader will be found. Do you understand?\"\n\nPavel sat there stunned for a moment. Could they not at least have some small talk?

However, this is not the end of Ksenofontov's ambition; he has imagined the city as an utopic example of Yakutian excellence, and subsequently as a cosmopolitan, free, and wealthy city in the far expanses of the North Pacific. Many members of his cabinet are worried this might cost a large sum of cash, but Ksenofontov has enough allies in the Parliament to pass it through, especially in the more socially-minded progressive sectors of his cabinet. Magadan has decided to be named this way as to be a form of expressing the cultural identity of the Lamut-Evenk people, who have praised the idea."

Despite our immense land size, most of it is extremely difficult to inhabit and create roads on. Therefore, the Governor-General has decided to pass an order for the construction of a planned city near Okhostk, called Dezhnevsk. This city is named this way in homage to the first expedition to the Far East, and to represent a beacon of Russian culture in the Pacific. The city is planned to be inhabited entirely by Russians, of course."

With the centrality of the Pacific Fleet to the old regime, it was of utmost importance to win over the sailors. The officers would always oppose freedom, but if the the sailors could be won it wouldn't matter what their superiors thought. And on that thought, Pavel was called to the stage.\n\n\"Comrades, you have heard many things about our revolution. That we are violent beasts who would kill anyone with a Russian tongue. But these are lies, peddled by the real Russophobes of Yakutia, the Starkocrats and Officers. While we simply want all in Yakutia to be equal, the Strakocracy wished to make the majority of Russians face the boot of a small clique in service to Moscow. Who sounds like the real Russophobes?\"\n\nThe soldiers applauded and chanted 'For a Free Russia!'. With that Pavel left the stage, happy the sailors were behind him but terrified for the future of an independent Siberia."

kck.17.title:0 "Matter of Cultural Relations"
kck.17.desc:0 "With East Asian nations liberated from the Russian and Japanese imperialist yoke alike, it came as a surprise to no one that some Yakut writers became interested in fostering good relations with their Korean colleagues. While the ruling "Juche" party of Korea is viewed skeptically by the Yakutia's populace at large, the fringe artistic elements from the Writers' Union in the city of Yakutsk have expressed solidarity with Sin Chaeho and their fellow Korean writers. Apparently, representatives of the Union such as Platon Oyunsky and Serafim Kulachikov have exchanged letters with Sin Chaeho himself, and in response received invitations for a Juche Literature Summit. Delighted, Kulachikov agreed to visit, and upon return told the Yakut capital's top newspaper that his organisation received grants from the Korean government to popularise Korean culture in Yakutia. In exchange, Korea would have some of the modernist Yakut novels translated to Korean and perhaps even serialised as childrens' comics, American-style. Experts in the literary world speculate that this Yakut-Korean \"manhwa\" may be crucial in promoting both Yakut and Korean culture not just in Japan and the Russian Far East, but in the West as well.\n\n Who knows, maybe even the Frenchmen might like it."

kck.18.title:0 "The Birth of a Flower"
kck.18.desc:0 "The earth began to slowly wake up from the winter's sleep. The temperatures in this ancient land often reached horribly low degrees, even in summer. This, however, began to slowly change. Factory chimneys began to dominate the wasteland and apartment blocks began to expand. Cities began to be born. They were not the biggest and the greatest, but they were symbols of a developing industry. But the center of human life was elsewhere. Igor - a young farmer driven out of Mongolia by the incessant and enduring conflicts between the shamanistic Bolsheviks, the mad baron, and God knows who else. After his father's death, he had nothing left to link him to this place, he decided that it would be best to cremate his father's body, as he was afraid of desecrating his burial place. So he carried in his backpack, in addition to the most necessary things, also a small urn with his ashes. He traveled such a long way, because he saw in this foreign country a chance for a new life. Radola Gajda, or whatever the Czech was called, began the process of colonizing Yakutia by bringing farmers from all over the Russian Empire so that they could at least try to grow anything on this frozen land. Igor noticed the offer as well as an additional benefit in the form of the possibility to buy a tractor and land at profitable prices. He couldn't afford to miss such an opportunity. After walking for several hours, he stopped and took the map out of the bundle. He had the position of his land marked on it. According to the assurances of the buyer, there was also supposed to be a small single-family cottage here. The sight he saw disappointed him quite badly. The hut was much smaller and would not hold a single cow in winter. The thatch was broken and in many places there were holes from decayed boards. The windows were shattered and glass lay in and beside the hut. He said to himself. \n\n\"I have a really long job ahead of me ... But even that is better than getting a bullet over there in Mongolia.\" \n\nAfter this brief reflection, he didn't say anything more, but started looking for wood, especially boards to rebuild the hut and forest litter to repair the thatch. He had his own nails with him, and it was the same with simple tools. Glass will have to be ordered from town, which he will do when he goes to buy a tractor. He boarded the windows and started the necessary repairs to his new home. After a day of repairs, he finally managed to rest, but his rest had to end quite quickly at 6:00 am on the frost of the next day. He left a relatively warm hut to start looking for a field for sowing. He noticed a place that was already quite shabby, so he didn't have to bother too much to finish the job. It wasn't perfect, but he wanted to get over it. It was not a large field, but without a plow and animals, it was a difficult task for one man. He finished around noon. He sighed tiredly and said to himself. \n\n\"My father would be proud of me to see what a farmer out of me\" \n\nHe became saddened, fleeing his childhood thoughts, and remembered one more task he had to fulfill. He went to get his father's urn and scattered ashes in the field. The ashes were sprayed like mist and quickly hit the ground prepared for sowing. Igor came home to live on and on the cold ground, on which the ashes had lay ..."

It was hideous and the bread was stale, but he had to eat something, not having time to prepare anything. Igor marched through forests and meadows for quite a long time, and finally he noticed the "gates" of Yakutsk, which were a series of long and tall buildings, breathed a sigh of relief that at least this element of the journey was behind him. He began to walk deeper into the city in his peasant clothes, some more chic people noticed him, but he did not differ that much from most of the city's inhabitants. However, it attracted the attention of someone else - of two young and wayward soldiers who accosted the man. \n\nAre you new to this city?\" \n\n\"Yes but to whom I'm speaking?\" \n\nIgor was kinda concerned as the men held guns on their shoulders. The soldier smiled slyly and said. \n\n\"Gefreiter Slopowsky and Private Toppowsky. We marched through the city for exercise and are currently on leave.

Until the evening he stood under the command, trying to punish the criminals, but the police were not willing to accept him at all, hearing rumors of a theft near the market square. Igor, not knowing what to do, began to slowly return to his home with an empty stomach and without a tractor or seed to sow."

He was driving it to the city now, which made his life much easier. He was more careful now, especially since he managed to smuggle a self-defense revolver from his old acquaintances in Mongolia. He was currently in one of the nearby villages to vote for a local county governor. Igor was not stupid and he understood that at least the regional elections counted because it dictated whether or not they would get any help. In the time after harvest, he also didn't have much work to do anymore, wanting to rest, so he figured he would organize a little tractor ride to see what it looked like. He waited a little, but not long to get into the ballot box. He didn't like the way the soldiers stood and watched the voting process, but he didn't care that much. He studied the card carefully, reading it from cover to cover. He was not a professor, but he could read and write, but he did not understand anything he read. The voting process was so complicated that he wasn't sure who he voted for. At one point he gave up on it and began to fill blindly, being annoyed with how the card was contoured in such a way that no one could understand. He gave his vote to the urn and left the room calmly towards the tractor. He got on it and fired it to start slowly moving away. It was not the most irritating moment in his life, but he had to say that the election was pointless because the person who was supposed to win would win anyway. It is not who votes for someone that counts, but who counts those votes. "

As a result, calls have been from all sides of the political nation to form an article of confederation for Yakutia. The Yakuts, and other minorities have petitioned for such reforms to be made in order to respect the traditional lifestyles of our ancestors alongside more material concerns over a confederation making running such a vast expanse of land easier.

Should there be a failure in any part of the country, blame will fall right onto us. Not to mention the nagging and agitation of political radicals that have plagued Russia for so long..\n\nTo combat this, ideas have been proposed of providing the plebeians with minor concessions and providing lip service to greater representation to political minorities. Alongside the granting of some basic and bog standard rights and ensuring a decent life to those who are subservient, we can be sure to eliminate all forms of challenge to our rule."

What we present is more durable than communist and liberal systems characterized by the egotism of individuals or the rule of the mob. When Zheltorossiya is in a constant state of chaos and agony caused by the ineptitude of Kerensky and his henchmen, we are constantly marching towards one goal of uniting our great Slavic homeland. We do it efficiently and our system does not allow any error that could threaten the existence of our country. It is not great ideals that count for us, but cold efficiency and absolute efficiency. This allows us to skillfully balance the interests of the people and the national interests without neglecting any of them."

However, we cannot risk that by some miracle this madman will overcome all difficulties, because even a bigger bastard and madman than the first Genghis will put his whip around the neck of the Slavs. Not to mention his sadism towards his subordinates.

However, what is this loyalty if the Cossacks ignore Russia's problems to focus on their petty interests, or even worse, because they betray Russia with its enemies. Emperor Valens made a huge mistake in allowing the formation of the Foederati and, worse, taking their people into the army as autonomous units which only sowed chaos. We cannot treat the Cossacks in a special way, because we will lose our discipline - both in the army and in the state. We must therefore crush the Cossack resistance in the south and wipe out their pitiful fiefdom. This is required if we want to create a strong Russia that will be able to compete with the West."

Neopagans, soft-communists, inept military junta and many other idiots tore up Piłsudski's body, taking a piece of his legacy for themselves.

This leaves our common mother, Slavia, at risk, as we cannot trust these Southerners to be able to handle the stability of the region on their own. The recent crisis that caused the SJNK coup almost destroyed Yugoslavia and divided it into envious states that hate each other and are used by all powers. We cannot allow this situation to happen again.  If the government in Belgrade cares so much about the unity of the Slavs, let them join us! However, if they do not want us, they have never loved the Slavs and only want to continue their particular interests. The Balkans will unite under one Slavic banner."

Erich Luddendorf, mixing his funny views of Prusianism (founded by Poles during the Prussian Homage), esotericism and neo-paganism (where the sacred tree was burned to wood chips long ago) and German ultranationalism. The last point is the most comical as the seat of reactionary Germanic nationalism which is Königsberg was founded by the Czech king Otokar II! How pathetic the Germanicas are when they feel they deserve the whole world and have achieved nothing throughout their entire existence.

In addition to the symbol of the conquest of Constantinople for Slavia and for God's glory, it is also an important place to control the Mediterranean trade, which is currently controlled by the Turks, British and Italians.

A new Age has come, in which the dying British Empire, some Napoleon, or God forbid, a German will not dominate! It is the time of the Slavorum Empire that deserves the title of the Fourth Rome.

KCK_life_of_admiral:0 "The Life of an Admiral"
KCK_life_of_admiral_desc:0 "When one spends extensive amounts of time on the crystal waters that envelop the globe, there is a certain shift in perspective. This phenomenon has been recorded among seamen and fishermen alike. The waves that rock the ship makes these men, even on land, walk in a very peculiar way, swaying side to side to accomodate for nonexistent currents. Life, even politics, is seen from the perspective of the sea towards the land, and not the other way around. Like a web of neural connections, the sea winds and routes become a map in the sailor's brain, more accurate than any city's layout.  \n\nAdmiral Stark is no different, with his peculiar swaying walk, his thalassocratic passions, and his love for mariner habits and songs. His secretaries report his curious habit of managing government affairs from a small pleasure ship, when his melancholic episodes are especially difficult and when the weather permits. The life of Admiral Stark is one of longing for life back at the sea, braving the untamed waters of the Arctic, and yet he drowns in dull paperwork. Necessary paperwork. Without it, the last link in the Russian Empire's steel chain from the Baltics to the warm Pacific would break. Stark's honour and resilience will avoid this disaster under any cost."

The easternmost point of Eurasia, this far off land cements our position as the masters of the continent. Our continued presence in the confines of the world is testament to our commitment to the Empire's everlasting grandeur. \n\nSince the end of the civil war, however, we've had trouble with the governorate's natives, unhappy because of lack of representation and the increasing number of Slavic settlers. This rabble led by Pavel Ksenofontov have been a thorn in our side for a long time, but new developments make their existence intolerable to us. We've come to know for a fact that their representatives receive paychecks signed by Tokyo. Japanese money and, we suspect, weapons, land every month in the Petropavlovsk harbour to supply the separatists. We must develop webs and infrastructure to tighten our grasp on Ksenofontov's neck and twist it before he poses any actual threat to our mastery over Yakutia."

Several agents inform us that they have begun to wake from their slumber and mobilisation is imminent. This is worrying news to our dwindling regiments and supplies. Unfortunately, help from Petrograd is exceptionally unlikely considering the general situation of the Empire, so we will have to make it work with what little we have. Patrols will be doubled everywhere we can, vigilance reinforced, and our navy will conduct reconnaissance operations along the coast. Should anything happen, we hope to be ready to hold any threat from the south as long as necessary."

Brave Slavs, oppressed under the Austrian yoke, decided to travel back to their ancestral homeland and enlist in the Tzar's army. Their adventure was thwarted by the designs of vile Republicans despite numerous victories in the Great War. However, many Czech brethren stayed behind and rallied under the Empire's banner, aiding us in our fraternal carnage. Under the command of Radola Gajda, they were crucial in victories against rebels throughout the country. As a reward for their service, they were granted settlement in Yakutia and engrained within the power mechanics of the governorate. \n\nFifteen years later, however, Gajda and his men are beginning to show signs of discontent. They are no closer to the liberation of Bohemia than in 1914, and many resent Kolchak's lack of action regarding the Panslavic cause. Although the Legion is a crucial element of our rulership, if they prove to be too problematic we will be forced to dispose of rebellious ringleaders eventually. For now, we will just observe Gajda's every step to make sure he walks in the right direction."

KCK_land_where_nothing_changes:0 "A Land Where Nothing Changes"
KCK_land_where_nothing_changes_desc:0 "It is a common misconception that the Bering strait freezes solid in harsh winters. Some assume one might even be able to walk on ice from Yakutia to Alaska. No such thing. In winter, strong currents break the ice sheet into large chunks. These icebergs, lazily pulled by the water, float further south until they melt on the warmer Pacific Ocean. This process has been repeated year after year since Genesis. Much like this sea, Yakutia is a slow and steady constant that despite its little movement and barely different patterns always operates in the same fashion. No radicals and no natives can change the natural course of our governorate, just like they can't change the fact the sea freezes on winter or the currents that govern the movement of the ice. It is but a natural principle and a law of the universe that we all must adapt to."
