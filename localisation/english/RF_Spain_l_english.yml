#COUNTRY DESCRIPTION#
SPR_DESC_MENU:0 "As is custom in the country, Spain is on the brink of civil war. Decades of political instability and succesive ineffective governments have brought Spain to the verge of regenerationist and anarchist revolution. As the Republic fights to survive, the future of the country is uncertain and tainted with bloodshed."
#LEADER DESCRITIONS#

#IDEAS#

SPR_spanish_spring:0 "The Spanish Spring"
SPR_spanish_spring_desc:0 "\"La primavera ha venido\ny don Alfonso se va.\nMuchos duques le acompañan\nhasta cerca de la mar."\n\nIn 1930, a secret pact of libertarians, socialists, liberals, regionalists, and republicans toppled the decadent Spanish crown and proudly proclaimed our young Republic in what was known as the Jaca Revolution. In Aragon, the army revolted against their corrupt superiors while in Madrid the people took to the streets and demanded the King's abdication. Alfonso XIII refused, clinging to his tyrannical position, and so he had to be assassinated if the nation was to gain freedom. It's been six years since those heroic moments, and everything we have and have done we owe to the bravado of these few honourable men. The Republican cause, despite many bitter moments, shines as brightly as ever, a guiding beacon for every free citizen in the country."
SPR_black_triennium:0 "The Black Triennium"
SPR_black_triennium_desc:0 "The crazed revolutionary fervour of the first years of the Republic have slowly quieted down into a tranquil peace. There are, unfortunately, many exceptions to this reality. The anarchists of the FAI-CNT began a brutal terror campaign across Spain after perceived slights during previous governments, and no honest industrialist dares step into his car without checking for explosives first. Targeted assassinations are not unheard of in cities like Barcelona and Sevilla, and sadly that isn't the end of it. Many other parties and movements have militarised themselves as a response. Street fights, gang wars, gun-slinging, armed scabs, all bread-and-butter across the country despite our best efforts. Our hands are tied, but is there anything that we may still do in our position ?"
SPR_behemoth_leviathan:0 "Behemoth against Leviathan"
SPR_behemoth_leviathan_desc:0 "Our government, owing to our democratic ideals, is a grandiose alliance of many different parties, big and small, and our cabinet reflects this in its varied composition. The management of the needs and wants of every party is a complex and lengthy process which the President has not always succeeded in. This only complicated further after the emergency powers just a year ago, and to the internal disputes we have to add fierce battles in the Cortes between our ragtag confederacy and the opposition. Ramón Franco has delegated most of this insufferable battlefield for his Minister of Interior Alejandro Lerroux. A true political animal, Lerroux is an unstoppable force that has kept the coalition together through thick and thin, and strikes against the enemies of the government without mercy. The Minister's growing power hasn't gone without criticism, and the leftmost of our colleagues have accused him of abusing his power through extralegal means. However, as long as any relevant phone-call has to go through Lerroux's office first, one can safely say both the alliance and his position will stand, no matter the cost."
SPR_separatism:0 "A Sentimental Atlas of Spain"
SPR_separatism_desc:0 "Even if regionalists are a key pillar of the Republic, it'd be a lie to say their demands have been in any way satisfied. Discontent has grown in Galicia, Vasconia, and Catalonia, where regionalist and nationalist parties already form ample majority, and even in historically pro-Spanish regions like Andalusia and Asturias the membership of these organisations soar and grow nonstop. Inspired by the successes of Ireland, every region also enjoys an uncountable number of cultural organisations, newspapers, magazines, and, in general, everything that may be used to foster a revival of their folk 'traditions'. Previous governments kept their distance with regionalism, and Lerroux's nationalist tendencies made sure we wouldn't change this course. Even Catalonia is still administered through the old monarchy's Commonwealth. The situation is still thankfully stable though not thanks to us, and it is best we begin to think of a new plan to mend the gap between Madrid and the periphery before the situation turns ugly and possibly bloody."
