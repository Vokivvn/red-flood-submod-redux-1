#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_ANDREW_COHEN_DESC:0 "Hailing from an Anglo-Jewish family, Cohen has roots to the oldest Ashkenazi family in Britain. Educated in Malvern College, Cohen has created his own vision of colonial policy; one of moderation. No one would be subject to any kind of supremacy, no white man or black man will be put under repression for who they are, and responsible government, law, and human wellbeing are at the forefront of his policy. A kind man, Cohen knows what needs to be done to secure the wellbeing of the West Africans and how to properly introduce them to Democracy."

WAF_an_experiment:0 "An Experiment in Democracy"
WAF_an_experiment_desc:0 "The West African Federation is an experiment in creating a new colonial policy for Britain's gigantic realm, which is slowly coming off the seams. However, just because Britain's empire is having troubles doesn't mean they won't intervene swiftly if our democracy begins getting the wrong ideas..."
WAF_language_division:0 "Language Division"
WAF_language_division_desc:0 "The former colonies that comprise the West African Federation are disunited in language matters, ethnic matters and finally religious matters - it is clear that, as much as we try, there is no good choice for a lingua franca that spans across all our territory. At least unless something drastic happens..."

waf.1.title:0 "1936 West African Elections"
waf.1.desc:0 "As promised by the British, the West African Federation will have free elections, and now they have come. All are welcome to vote, and thusly determine the future of the Federation. The Liberáls seek to enrich French and African culture under a classical liberal economy with welfare policies, and the Loyalists seek to strenghten relations with Britain and promote the English language. Who shall win?"
waf.1.a:0 "The Liberáls under Zinsou win the elections!"
waf.1.b:0 "The Loyalists under Cohen hold on!"
waf.1.c:0 "The Loyalists under Edward Akufo-Addo win the elections!"
waf.2.title:0 "The West African Civil War!"
waf.2.desc:0 "The Loyalists under Akufo-Addo have created an immense rift between the peoples of West Africa and people from all over the country have become immensely divided. A populist movement called the FLSN, the Front de la Salvation National, has slowly taken over the Federation as we barely hold on to the cities. Civil War has come."
waf.2.a:0 "Death to the enemies of the people against imperialism!"
waf.2.b:0 "Death to traitors to the Commonwealth!"
