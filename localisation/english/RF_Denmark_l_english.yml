#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_MARIE_SN_DESC:0 "Marie-Sophie Nielsen is a fervent communist, who quickly embraced the People's Republic and joined the SDAP, pleased with the results. Alas, the unthinkable happened. Instead of embracing the revolution and removing the stain of liberalism, the new government started collaborating with capitalists, allowing the reactionaries to roam free in Denmark. How could this happen? How could the revolution be this soft? She needed to act, and along with her fellow communists, they split from the SDAP to form the DKP. Further collaboration with Germany, Abolish such idiotic things like the Parliament and cement a Permanent Revolution has been her party's talking points for years, and now that her party was elected into power, the promises are soon to become reality."
POLITICS_PETER_MUNCH_DESC:0 "Peter Rochegune Munch, born 1870, despite being born in a poor background, managed to graduate in history, but went on to leave his true mark in the field of politics. Even during the Zahle government in the Kingdom, Munch and the Radikale Venstre were influential. \n\nThe Civil War was an opportunity for Peter, who closely worked with the Stauning government, but soon the RV would fall over and move on to follow a more conservative path, right under his watch. Now that he is the Formand of Denmark, Peter Munch not only needs to reform his country; he needs to reform his party as well, or else the revolutionary spirit alive might as well vanish."
POLITICS_THORVALD_STAUNING_DESC:0 "Born in 1873, Thorvald Stauning has always been a man involved in Left-wing politics. Stauning, along with Carl Theodor Zahle, was responsible for the creation of the People's Republic Of Denmark, after the quick skirmishes that could be considered a Danish Civil War. \n\nStauning, always with his remarkable moderate and progressive views, ensured the country would stay a free and democratic republic after the revolution, and thus, in the first election, he was elected Formand, but for all his liberalism, the radicals and fervent revolutionaries active in the fledgling state's formation felt discontent, and split to form their own parties. Nevertheless, Thorvald's reforms made him extremely popular with the people, and the SDAP, the greatest pillar of the republic, has no reason to go away."

#IDEAS#
DEN_warschauer_vertrag:0 "Der Warschauer Vertrag"
DEN_democratic_road:0 "The Democratic Road To Socialism"
DEN_democratic_road_desc:0 "\"Socialism without democracy is unthinkable\"\n-Karl Kautsky\n\nTo be revolutionary without chaos, to avoid stagnation without plunging into senseless violence, to act on the public will while still accounting for the minority voice, to work towards both socialism and democracy. This has been the goal of the Danish revolution since the summer of 1918 and it will stay the goal until this republic dies, from the outside or from within."

DEN_conservative_revolution:0 "Conservative Revolution"
DEN_conservative_revolution_desc:0 "\"Democracy can only be measured on the existence of an opposition\"\n-Poul Henningesen\n\nEver since the revolution, conservatism has been politically dead. The elites and politicians who supported it left en masse and those who didn't by in large have refused to work within the republic. Five years ago, that all changed.\n\nDanish Unity finally provided a genuine alternative to the liberal and socialist parties. This has had mixed results for the health of the republic. On the one hand, it has certainly hurt the monarchist resistance by presenting a legal alternative to right wingers. And, of course, it is always good for citizens to be able to express their opinions....\n\nBut Unity, ironically, threatens the unity of the republic by bearing to light some long standing divisions on what the nature of the republic is. There was always a quiet assumption by the far left that conservatism was quasi-illegal, allowing them to more easily tolerate working with liberals. This false assumption has been shattered and the far left is getting restless. And Unity themselves feel as if they are not treated as an equal party and are merely tolerated.\n\nOne thing is for certain, the conservative revolution will not stop by itself."
