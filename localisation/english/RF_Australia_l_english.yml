#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
politics_joseph_lyons_desc:0 "Joseph Lyons, the tenth prime minister of Australia and traitor to the labor party. Having left the party following the 1931 split due to the Labor parties increasing left movement. Lyons with his fellow MPs joined with the nationalist party to form the United Australia party with Joseph Lyons as its leader. With a quick victory in the 1931 election Joseph Lyons has led the country since 1931 in a coalition with the country party and has so far been successful in dealing with the depression acting as the countries treasurer since 1935. While Joseph Lyons continues to work over Australia, one question that is often asked is how long he can do this for."
