#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_PANTEA_DESC:0 "Gherman Pantea, Savior of the Republic, Mayor of Chisinau, and now, leader of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Moldova. One of the founding figures of the Republic and the suppressor of the anarchist threat, Gherman Pantea has always been respected by the various ruling governments and the populace. And so, with the recent scandal that nearly plunged the country into complete chaos, it is he who was unanimously given the authority to restore and keep order until the upcoming June elections. He himself does not participate in the politickeering, instead being content with the mayoral seat in the capital, but he suspects that the task will require him to make some decisions that will have a lasting effect on the political landscape, even if he makes them just to calm down the population."
POLITICS_LUPU_DESC:0 "Chairman of the Labor Party, Nicolae Lupu started out his political career in the Kingdom down south as co-chairman of the SR-adjacent republican-leaning party, but with Gheorghe Diamandy's death right after the Russian Revolution, he has transformed the party in the Poporanist image. What motivated the move to Moldova, however, has been the immediate denouncement of the Republicans as traitors to the Kingdom, a move that placed Lupu, perhaps involuntarily, on the Schismatic side of the National Schism. The moderately successful Labor Party has now risen to power, however that rise came at a cost of many of Cocea's supporters flocking to the party, which in turn has modified its program, despite Lupu's vision. Now, Lupu aims to unite Greater Romania and retransform the Party back into a Poporanist one."
POLITICS_MOTRU_PRANK_DESC:0 "The Leader of the Romanianist Party, Constantin Radulescu-Motru is perhaps one of the more outlandish politicians of the Region, who to some is a Poporanist, to some is a Conservative, and to others he is entirely his own, enclosed, bubble. Residing in Iasi at the time of the establishment of the Republic, Radulescu-Motru saw no need to go back to the Kingdom, especially after making a quick calculation of chances of influencing politics. After all, an anti-establishment republic would be prone to influence from new ideologies, and so he made an attempt at creating his own, dubbed \"Romanianism\". It did not see much following, partly because of the various anti-democratic tones to it. Over the years, Constantin changed his views, and now Romanianism is closer to Poporanism, with some viewing it as a successor to Stere's idea, even if Motru sternly disagrees, harshly criticizing the Poporanist current. Now, given the mandate by the people, he seeks to unite Romania and modernize it under his vision."
POLITICS_MOTRU_DESC:0 "The Leader of the Romanianist Party, Constantin Radulescu-Motru is perhaps one of the more outlandish politicians of the Region, who to some is a Poporanist, to some is a Conservative, and to others he is entirely his own, enclosed, bubble. Residing in Iasi at the time of the establishment of the Republic, Radulescu-Motru saw no need to go back to the Kingdom, especially after making a quick calculation of chances of influencing politics. After all, an anti-establishment republic would be prone to influence from new ideologies, and so he made an attempt at creating his own, dubbed \"Romanianism\". It did not see much following, partly because of the various anti-democratic tones to it. Over the years, Constantin has officially changed his views, however unofficially, he remained convinced in the first form of Romanianism. Now, given emergency powers, Constantin seeks to unite Romania in the Romanianist image, whatever it takes."
POLITICS_POPESCU_DESC:0 "The Leader of the Conservative-Democratic Party, Stelian Popescu is primarily known for running the \"Universul\" newspaper. During the Russian Invasion he chose to follow Take Ionescu in establishing an Entente-cooperative government, however unlike Take, he did not become convinced that a republic was needed, even after being officially condemned as a traitor after the establishment of the Republic of Moldova. For Popescu, the Republic is just what came to be in the aftermath. After Ionescu's death, the PCD almost ceased to exist, but Popescu, along with Nicolae Titulescu, managed to save the party, although they soon became divided on what the \"new\" PCD's program should be. Popescu himself advocated for a stronger emphasis on nationalism, while Titulescu advocated that they should remain \"true to Ionescu's vision\". Now, the PCD is the ruling force for the second time, seeking to finally reunify Romania before all else."
POLITICS_CODREANU_DESC:0 "The infamous Capitanul of the Legion of Archangel Michael, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, is a man that needs no introduction. From humble beginnings in Nicolae Iorga's Democratic Nationalist Party, through his service in the Great War, Codreanu's life has been nothing but sacrifice for the Nation. When A.C. Cuza left the PND, so did Codreanu, eventually joining him in his National-Christian Defence League, however Corneliu ended up leaving the LANC in 1926, believing it had little to no chance of ever conquering the hearts of Romanians. He immediately created his own movement, known as the Legion of Archangel Michael, which quickly gained support among the irredentist populace, seeking to reunify Romania under the reactionary, ultranationalist, banner. While he took inspiration from the Black Hundreds over in Russia, he did introduce a lot of his own elements, making the Legion a one-of-a-kind movement. In 1930, soon after King Ferdinand I died, Codreanu approved of Mihai Stelescu's plan to coup the Romanian government. That failed, however, and so the movement was forced to not only go to exile into Moldova, but also to adopt an entirely new strategy to succeed. His time in Moldova has landed him almost imprisoned and the Legion nearly outlawed, saved only by the recent scandal involving Nicolae Cocea. Now, he seeks not only to reunite Romania, but also to enact revenge - both on the traitor Stelescu and on the corrupt King Carol and his Liberal clique."
POLITICS_ELIADE_DESC:0 "The New Capitanul of the Legion of Archangel Michael, Mircea Eliade, has for a long time experimented with various political ideas, but it was Codreanu's thought that eventually stole his heart. Oriented towards learning from his young years, he went on to study at the University of Bucharest, meeting Nae Ionescu, who had a great influence over the student's views. In 1927 he went to study in the Raj, at the University of Calcutta, sponsored by the Maharaja of Kassimbazar, but in 1930 he was forced to leave as the Raj was collapsing. He eventually made his way to Moldova, but was unable to cross the border back into Romania. Therefore, he went on to study again at the University of Iasi, where he published his thesis on Yoga practices and came into contact with the members of the Legion, and found that his views closely matched theirs, and joined the formation. While he never was fully on-board with Codreanu's program, he found the movement to be the only one able to reconcile Romania with God. Now, standing as the Capitanul after Corneliu's death and his quick election, he is taking steps towards a so-called \"Christian revolution\"."
POLITICS_CALLIMACHI_DESC:0 "Scarlat Callimachi, the Leading Figure of the Anarchist Movement of Moldova, has only become relevant pretty recently with the chaos caused by the scandal involving Nicolae Cocea. His background as an anarchist revolutionary goes as far back as to 1907, when he first-hand witnessed the Peasant Revolt, which shaped his views for years to come. When the Republic of Moldova was founded, he became an associate of Ilie Catarau and together they almost managed to overthrow the government, with their plan stopped only by Gherman Pantea's intervention, which led to Catarau's death and the disappearence of any power they held. This, however, did not stop Scarlat, and for years he has tormented the Moldovan authorities, earning him the nickname of \"the Uncapturable\". Now he stands at the top, willing to continue what almost came to fruition those long years ago."

#IDEAS#
MOL_slavic_separatism:0 "Slavic Separatism"
MOL_legionnaire:0 "Legionnaires on the Streets"
MOL_legionnaire_desc:0 "The infamous Legion of Archangel Michael is constantly stretching the boundaries of the law - paramilitaries, assassinations committed by members, however, on an organizational level, the Legion remains perfectly law-abiding. With the recent scandal involving Nicolae Cocea, their activity has risen to unbelievable levels, making it clear, that if Moldova is to be stabilized, the Legion has to go."
MOL_provisional:0 "The Provisional Government"
MOL_provisional_desc:0 "Nicolae Cocea's ties to the Transylvanian politicians have resulted in a massive scandal, leading to an unanimous vote of no confidence against his government, appointment of Gherman Pantea as the interim President, and perhaps most importantly, new elections, due to be held in June. Due to the sudden downfall of his Social Democratic Party, people are flocking left and right, trying to find a new political option for them."
MOL_our_republic:0 "Our Republic"
MOL_our_republic_desc:0 "Born together alongside the Russian Republic, our Republic fits a similar role in Romanian politics, has a similar system to the Russians in the Far East, but most importantly, is fully democratic, free from the wishes of kings and corrupt politicians alike."
