#DECISIONS (1.5 Update)#

#EVENTS#

tai.1.t:0 "Breaking Free"
tai.1.d:0 "The Provisional Independence Council was set up to safeguard Taiwan against any immediate attempts to subjugate it upon declaring independence. However it was unstable from the start, made up of liberal moderates such as the influential Thomas Liao, Nationalist icon Chiang Wei-shui and Communist leaders. The group can scarecly agree on whether they will keep the name Taiwan or be recognised as Formosa, never mind matters of economy or defence. The council is rapidly disintegrating and the island faces a potent choice in the near future, the exact players involved and their policies remain to seen however..."
tai.1.a:0 "At least we have self-determination now"
tai.1.b:0 "Despots never have these problems"

tai.1001.t:0 "The Aboriginal Rebellion"
tai.1001.d:0 "The Aboriginal tribes in the highlands have been making trouble for the various leaders of Taiwan for decades, now with the absence of the Japanese colonists, Mona Rudao the notorious leader of the Atayal Seediq tribes has launched ferocious attacks on Han settlers in the Northern Highlands, much worse than the Wushe incidents of 1930. Among his insurgents the orphans of the first Wushe incident, boys whose fathers, brothers, uncles and cousins were beheaded at the hands of Japanese collaborating natives. Now eager to return the favour, these savage warriors are threatening not only the their local clan rivals and the Japanese settlers, but the Chinese as well. Mona's men are a formidable guerrilla force, able to strike at any time and disappear into the brush at will. They are united by a desire for autonomy and the retreat of Chinese settlers from their traditional lands. The decision of how to handle Mona has become a serious issue for the unstable provisional government, some suggest the natives should be Sinicised and their cultures eliminated along similar lines the Japanese had planned. Others suggest they be allowed their autonomy and further that they be protected by law, their unique identity is becoming a new focal point for Taiwanese national sentiment, separate from the Min-Hokkien and Hakka-Chinese identities that dominate the West of island."
tai.1001.a:0 "Taiwan is Chinese. Find Mona and kill him"
tai.1001.b:0 "The Natives Deserve Recognition. Accept his demands"

tai.2.t:0 "Free Elections Organised"
tai.2.d:0 "Out of the turmoil of the Provisional Independence Council a plebicite has been organised at last. The TPP look set to win, but the Party is split. The left wing of the party led by the talismanic Cai Pei-Huo commands significant support, while the respected teacher Dr. Thomas Liao has returned to Taiwan to join the right wing of the party and lead it towards accord with Nanjing. On the other hand significant radical elements may push to disrupt the elections altogether..."
tai.2.a:0 "Democracy offers stability in these trying times"
tai.2.b:0 "Democracy may solve nothing in the end"

tai.3.t:0 "The Chaos Descends"
tai.3.d:0 "The Provisional Independence Council has failed and the Government is dissolved, with no leadership and shortages beginning, chaos has gripped the streets in Taipei. In the countryside Aboriginal elements raid the lands of Chinese farmers and in urban areas students are up in arms. The crisis deepens by the day as parties begin to organise 'People's Militias' to defend their properties and beat up political opponents. Some say the TCP is organising a coup, others whisper about the mysterious TA fliers covering entire buildings and street signs, they appear to pop up in the thousands overnight."
tai.3.a:0 "Will someone please DO something?!"
tai.3.b:0 "This whole independence thing seems to have been a mistake"

tai.4.t:0 "Leftists Attack the Government"
tai.4.d:0 "At last men of action have taken matters into their own hands. At dawn the People's Militias of the TCP and TPP joined forces in a rare show of soldiarity, they assembled near the University grounds and were soon joined by disgruntled students. The band marched through Taipei into the morning, attracting a police presence, some officers simply joined the march while others looked on. By the time the march reached the Government district they had swelled into a mob, they were now joined by factory workers and civilians waiving flags and shouting slogans. When the march approached the National Assembly they found it guarded by soldiers and police, for an hour a stand-off ensued, then the first rock was thrown. Then the first fires were lit. Finally the first shot was fired. From then it was a battle, soldiers and police engaged in shoot-outs while the mob rushed into the building. When the dust had settled the people had won, those among them shot dead were now martyrs of the Revolution, including some party leaders. More importantly Taiwan now has leadership."
tai.4.a:0 "At last!"
tai.4.b:0 "At what cost?"

tai.5.t:0 "TCP Takes Power"
tai.5.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Revolution it didn't take long for the TCP to take charge of the situation, their supporters were more numerous, several TPP leaders were dead, and it only took one good lie to convince the crowds the TPP had killed fellow revolutionaries in the crossfire. After that it was trivial to arrest any who didn't swear feilty to the new Government."
tai.5.a:0 "The traitors get what they deserve"
tai.5.b:0 "So much for Solidarity"

tai.6.t:0 "TPP Takes Power"
tai.6.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Revolution the TPP came out on top. TCP leaders had been killed in the crossfire and without their leadership the mob simply obeyed the loudest voice in the room, in this case - Cai Pei-Huo. Some TCP members refused to lay down their arms, prompting their arrest and 'trial' by the remaining Police. Cai Pei-Huo quickly set about smoothing over some soured relations and even invited leaders of the other parties to help form the Government."
tai.6.a:0 "The icon prevails!"
tai.6.b:0 "Moderates will betray the Revolution"

tai.7.t:0 "Radicals in the Streets"
tai.7.d:0 "With the PIC all but dissolved and the other political powers beating eachother up, a new force has come to play a role, the Taiyang Association. Despite the name this group of radicals has its own organised street gang, visible by their flamboyant yellow uniforms and blue arm-bands. They have quickly set about plastering the streets of all major urban areas with fliers. The posters are adorned with pastel colours and speak of the cultural soul of Taiwan being in a state of decay, only the TA can save it. Attached is a treatise, a brief manifesto from the painter Tan Ting-pho. The Pen and Pencil Treatise has spread throughout the island and taken the interest of many, calls to take steps further than the TPP and GMD, calls to westernise and modernise Taiwan through cultural revival and social cooperation. Trading the malaise of post-imperial China for a new energetic European-style revolutionary state, the island can become great as never before! All it will take is the will and vision to act. The party has been denounced as French boot-lickers and sell-outs to western imperialists by their opponents, but there is no denying their growing popularity."
tai.7.a:0 "The Treatise will guide the nation"
tai.7.b:0 "Let's hope these radicals know what they're doing"

tai.8.t:0 "Liao's Faction Wins Election"
tai.8.d:0 "After tense polling, Thomas Liao's moderate wing of the TPP has won the election, when interviewed Mr. Liao thanked his supporters and pledged to keep out foreign powers and make Taiwan a strong and prosperous land. As the civil war rages on in the mainland, the TPP awaits the outcome, eager for their allies in the Guomindang to unite the Nation."
tai.8.a:0 "Cooler heads have prevailed it seems"
tai.8.b:0 "At least we can move on now"

tai.9.t:0 "Cai Pei-Huo's Faction Wins Election"
tai.9.d:0 "The victory of the TPP may well have been a foregone conclusion, but the winner of the election was not. The TPP's leaders have come together around  Cai Pei-Huo. The fledgling republic is now poised to align itself with the rest of the left-Guomindang."
tai.9.a:0 "At last, stability"
tai.9.b:0 "Good news for Fujian"

tai.10.t:0 "Tan Ting-pho Emerges as Leader"
tai.10.d:0 "TA leader Tan Ting-pho has gone public at last, his latest address was in public and in person, despite the risk of assassination. He declared his true intentions for Taiwan, even as he spoke the Yellow-Jackets stormed the Government buildings. They were armed with painted rifles and pistols with intricate carvings, they quickly swept away any resistance at gun-point and promptly tore down the symbols of old colonial rule and burnt them. A large print of Tan Ting-pho's self portrait was hung in the main parliament chamber, government officials who refused to swear loyalty to the new leader in sight of the painting were shot. Tan pledged to use their ashes in his next work."
tai.10.a:0 "Now THIS is a leader I can get behind"
tai.10.b:0 "Who the hell paints with men's ashes?!"

tai.11.t:0 "Tan Ting-pho Speaks!"
tai.11.d:0 "TA leader Tan Ting-pho announced the start of his party's rule today, the leading members of the Chi-Hsing Society took to the Taipei city square, they stood atop podiums and spoke to an entranced crowd of the great future that lies before their island nation. They lionised the bravery of native leader Mona Rudao, they called on their fellow citizens to begin a frenzy of popular expression. The Yellow-Jackets kept relative order as the crowds were whipped into a mob of discontent, then together the Club leaders and the people marched into Government unopposed. The Club announced that the Assembly Hall would become a new exhibition of the works of the people, most forms of expression were permitted to be displayed. Notable exceptions included traditional Chinese or Japanese works. Taiwanese Aboriginal works were subject to ideological scrutiny, those that did not please the Club's sensibilities were burnt. The seat of Government now resides at the Club's headquarters in Chiayi, its first act - replacing the Taiwanese Police with it's own Yellow-Jackets. A spate of brutal reprisals against Communist activists has resulted in the Police Stations being nick-named 'Hornets Nests' by some locals."
tai.11.a:0 "The Club seem very capable"
tai.11.b:0 "Do the ends justify the means?"

tai.12.t:0 "Taiwan Reaches Out to Tokyo"
tai.12.d:0 "In these desperate times true comrades ought to stick together. Since the revolution is isolated in Asia, the few who remain true to the proletariat must help one another in solidarity. To this end Taipei has taken the decision to reach out to Tokyo and offer what meagre support we can offer the Japanese. Perhaps in return they will assist us in the future."
tai.12.a:0 "Together Comrades, we will be unstoppable!"
tai.12.b:0 "As long as we aren't a colony again right?"

tai.153.b:0 "I guess the Empire isn't as sick as they say."

tai.16.t:0 "Propose The Java Treaty"
tai.16.d:0 "Relations with the Dutch could be better, they could also be worse, as a former colony there is some history between our nations. That said the Dutch are a neutral party and stable Monarchy with strong economic resources in Indonesia. We both may benefit from an 'Exports-for-Rubber' trade deal that would boost both economies and allow us the material goods to make significant military defences."
tai.16.a:0 "Modern Materials For Modern Times."
tai.16.b:0 "Rubber For Car Tyres? Or Rubber For Bombers?"

tai.161.t:0 "Taiwan Proposes A Deal"
tai.161.d:0 "The Taiwanese, recently independent thanks to the Japanese civil war, have approached us with plans for a trade deal. Netherlands gets the economic benefits of Taiwanese exports, the Taiwanese in return have asked for a share in the rubber production of Indonesia."
tai.161.a:0 "Of course, we both stand to benefit."
tai.161.b:0 "No, there are more profitable customers."

tai.162.t:0 "Taiwan Strikes Deal with the Dutch"
tai.162.d:0 "The Dutch are eager to work with the few remaining democracies in the world and having a friend in asia could prove advantageous to them. So they have graciously accepted our offer and have agreed to a 15 year rubber export plan to Taiwan. In addition the Dutch have expanded their diplomatic and economic connections in Taipei, both the embassy and stock exchange now have expanded Dutch presence."
tai.162.a:0 "Welcome back old friend."
tai.162.b:0 "Hopefully they don't make us their Sinasappel again."

tai.163.t:0 "Netherlands Denies Rubber Trade"
tai.163.d:0 "The Dutch, ever protective over their Indonesian colony and its assets, have refused our offer, fearing communist subversion of Taiwan and subsequent revolution in their colony."
tai.163.a:0 "Darn it, we'll have to look to Indochina instead."
tai.163.b:0 "Darn it we'll have to pay the tariffs instead."

tai.17.t:0 "The Guam Agreement"

tai.171.b:0 "We'll never cede an inch of American land."

tai.172.t:0 "Taiwan Strikes Deal with the USA"
tai.172.d:0 ""
tai.172.a:0 "I can see it now - 'Made in Taiwan' on American products."
tai.172.b:0 "Hopefully the Japanese navy don't mind the traffic."

tai.173.t:0 "America Dismisses Taiwan's Proposed Trade"
tai.173.d:0 ""
tai.173.a:0 "Curse those fools."
tai.173.b:0 "Bless their hearts."

tai.18.t:0 "The Steel Deal"
tai.18.d:0 "Australia is an important steel producer for the Commonwealth, we should propose a steel trade deal with them, they sell us the raw materials and we sell them the products manufactured afterwards. Sure, some of the steel will make guns but we don't have to tell them that."
tai.18.a:0 "Send The Diplomats!"
tai.18.b:0 "Hopefully They Trust Our Intentions."

tai.181.t:0 "Taiwan Proposes Steel Deal"
tai.181.d:0 "The new government of Taiwan has approached us with a proposal for a share in the steel industry, the Taiwanese will recieve a share in Australian steel production and Australia will recieve low or tariff-free imports on Taiwanese goods."
tai.181.a:0 "Business is good."
tai.181.b:0 "There are more lucrative markets."

tai.182.t:0 "Taiwan Strikes Deal with Australia"
tai.182.d:0 "Australian and Taiwanese diplomats have signed a historic economic deal. Taiwanese trade in Australian Steel will now be much more lucrative and simplified. Lower tariffs and industrial investments will help boost the Australian production and Taiwanese industry."
tai.182.a:0 "More steel means more gunboats!"
tai.182.b:0 "The iron mongers lick their lips."

tai.183.t:0 "Australia Shoots Down Steel Deal"
tai.183.d:0 "The Australian delegation to Taiwan has reported the Canberra government has opted to priorities Commonwealth economic integration over investment in foreign markets. Sadly the deal has fallen through as a result."
tai.183.a:0 "How will we build our ships?!"
tai.183.b:0 "There are alternatives."

tai.19.t:0 "The Formosa Pact Signed"
tai.19.d:0 ""The Formosa Pact is a formal diplomatic guarantee of protection over Taiwan from the Dutch and British. Should the island be attacked the two will be obligated to defend her.
tai.19.a:0 "Taiwanese Never Ever Shall Be Slaves!"
tai.19.b:0 "Are We Trying To Annoy Tokyo?"

tai.20.t:0 "Pacific Trade Organisation Established"
tai.20.d:0 "The Pacific Trade Organisation or PTO is a formal guarantee of protection over Taiwan from the United States of America. It is also an economic and technological deal that will make Taiwan one of America's closest partners in Asia."
tai.20.a:0 "The Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave."
tai.20.b:0 "The Land of the Lap Dogs and the Home of the War Hawks."

tai.21.t:0 "Infiltrate the Cities"
tai.21.d:0 "In order to truly usurp the cliques work should begin on preparing People's Party loyalists and operatives in the major cities for revolution, if the right men and women can be found we can take over the show without a shot fired. Surely there are enoug dissatisfied police and administrators to facilitate such a power change."
tai.21.a:0 "This is the first step to uniting the nation."
tai.21.b:0 "Are we sure this is going to work?"

tai.22.t:0 "Infiltrate the Countryside"
tai.22.d:0 "Work has begun to agitate for defection to the People's party among the farmers of rural southern China. The emphasis on rebellion against Mandarin Imperialism and northern rule has struck a chord with some and the disenchanted who saw the revolution as a failure after the expedition. They now await the day that the People's Party calls them to arms against their masters."
tai.22.a:0 "We can't possibly lose if we control the food supply!"
tai.22.b:0 "We can't possibly win if they control the factories."

tai.23.t:0 "Cities in Revolt"
tai.23.d:0 "Urban areas across southern China have broken out in revolt against their local overlords. People's militias have been formed to defend them against retaliation and the warlords are now in a state of flux as their base support falls out from beneath them. It will take some time for Taiwan to secure control fully but soon a Republic of China will be established and the people of the south at least will be united at last."
tai.23.a:0 "The Revolution has begun!"
tai.23.b:0 "Another Revolution has begun..."

tai.231.t:0 "The Flag Flies!"
tai.231.d:0 "The TPP flag is raised across the cities! Across the GMD clqiues these upstarts are occupying China piece by piece."
tai.231.a:0 "The Revolution is inevitable."
tai.231.b:0 "Crush them!"
tai.231.c:0 "Conceed to the TPP's oversight."

tai.24.t:0 "Agricultural Workers take up Arms"
tai.24.d:0 "The farmers are rising up! At the signal of our infiltrators the people have taken up arms against the local leaders and placed TPP loyalists in power. These regions have large populations but no means of industry and so the require the cities to revolt as well to be supported. already a reaction from the GMD factions on the mainland is being organised, if we do not act quickly the revolution may be crushed."
tai.24.a:0 "The people take up arms!"
tai.24.b:0 "The people take pitchforks to rifles."

tai.241.t:0 "Country-Wide Defection"
tai.241.d:0 "The countryside with its many minor towns and villages is now awash with TPP loyalist leaders securing roads and bridges, as the militias assemble they guard the grain stores and crops that will fuel the revolution."
tai.241.a:0 "The Revolution is inevitable."
tai.241.b:0 "These traitors will be crushed."
tai.241.c:0 "Accept TPP Sovereignty."

tai.25.t:0 "Reactionary Organisations Shut Down"
tai.25.d:0 "The remanants of Japanese rule and notable religious radicals are a blemish on the new Taiwan. New regulations on religious activities have come into place that effectively make non-state-sanctioned faith practises illegal. Japanese-Taiwanese people have been placed under observation and the scant few monarchists have simply disappeared over night. New art works in the halls of the Chiayi Palace depict broken crowns and a good many Chrysanthemums aflame."
tai.25.a:0 "They were traitors all, let the past lie."
tai.25.b:0 "Many were patriots, but simply disloyal."

tai.26.t:0 "Socialist Organisations Shut Down"
tai.26.d:0 "The remains of the left-GMD on Taiwan have persisted as a thorn in the side of the TA for long enough, subverting our rule with talk of proletarian revolution and their inisitent sino-philia has nauseated the leadership in towns and cities up and down the west coast. It is high time to rid ourselves of such subversive elements. Thus a grand operation to root out the leftists and make examples of their leaders has been put into action, thousands of Yellow-Jackets and Chi-Hsing Volunteer Soldiers have been organised into a 'Counter-Cultural Defence Division' with explicit orders to shoot known Communists and Socialist Leaders on sight, with arrest warrants on anyone found in locations known to be used for leftist gatherings. Within weeks Taiwan will have no leftists to speak of who aren't dead in a ditch or being re-educated as members of the Mason's corp building stone works and statues across the island."
tai.26.a:0 "They changed nothing, we are the future!"
tai.26.b:0 "Aren't we both Revolutionaries?"

tai.27.t:0 "TA Purges Technocrats From Ranks"
tai.27.d:0 "Some among the GMD defectors to the TA developed sympathies for the ideas of exiled Japanese technocrats. Acheiving a new future through appointing a technocratic government and placing sacreed importance on education is a seemingly innocuous vision to many. The party doesn't see it that way however, and now that the TA's power has been consolidated, there is little need for such elitist ideas as these any longer. Beginning with impromptu party conferences across Taiwan, the technocratic ranks were quickly singled out and ejected from party grounds - directly into the arms of waiting Yellow-Jackets outside. Some of Taiwan's best and brightest have now been placed under house arrest and had their political powers stripped. A select few ring-leaders have disappeared entirely following the conferences, lending to rumours that many among the 'Clique of Elitist Traitors' have been murdered by the state. Adding to suspicions is the emergence of a new piece in the Chiayi Hall of Arts, a grand canvas adorned in Taiwanese characters written in a suspiciously blood-scented oil, the characters read 'The Future Belongs To Men Of Culture'."
tai.27.a:0 "It is not about who is most intelligent, only who has the greatest vision."
tai.27.b:0 "Without the greatest minds how will we bring about a new future?"

tai.28.t:0 "The Legend Of Liao Tianding"
tai.28.d:0 "For many years, Liao Tianding stood as a symbol of anti-Japanese sentiment in Taiwan. Although he committed many crimes, including murdering a man, most in Taiwan see them as necessary evils against a foreign oppressor. With Taiwan's newly won independence, the new government has decided to honor Liao Tianding with a monument in his hometown. At its unveiling, Liao Tianding appeared in person to receive thanks from Taiwanese citizens and honors from state officials. From here on out, Taiwanese parents will tell their children tales of the man who stole from Japan and gave to Taiwan."
tai.28.a:0 "Woe to the sheriff of Chiayi."

tai.29.t:0 "Food Crisis Spurs Innovation"
tai.29.d:0 "Following our Republic's recent cutting of ties with Japan, and pending our recognition by potential trading partners in China and beyond, our democratic government has been hard at work with food relief efforts for those communities which have been left without food. One member of such a community, Momofuku Ando, has used his resources gained from the free market to invent and distribute a new food product, "Cup Noodles". The product features a cheap cup filled with cost-effective yet nutritious ingredients including classic egg noodles and various vegetables.  This new product has become the new national food of Taiwan, flying off of shelves in low-income communities."

tai.30.d:0 "Following Taiwan's shocking rise to independence, Japanese settlers in the tiny island nation have begun to fear for their own safety in the absence of Japanese authorities. Desperate cries have gone out to every faction which might be able to help from Japanese settlers of varying ideologies. Communists have denounced their ties to the Empire and called on Okawa Shumei to bring the region under Pan-Asian control, Accelerationist artists have negotiated deals with Futurist groups to provide their unique artistic and philosophical talents, and those in the middle have appealed to the more pacifist elements of the various democratic parties. Further proof that no matter what happens, someone will always be willing to collaborate with their enemies to save their own skin."

Somewhat baffled, police presented him with evidence that tuition payments to the University of Taipei had been traced back to him. Ando is expected to fight the case, claiming that the government is enforcing vague laws in an overly broad manner in order to target certain individuals.

Taiwan will have it's role to play in this movement, between us in the South and Japan in the North, the revolution will be unstoppable. However, priorities and ambitions will have to be tempered as competing claims are worked out and the issue of potential allies in China is resolved."
