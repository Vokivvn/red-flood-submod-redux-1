#Brief history
YUG_DESC_MENU:0 "Yugoslavia is, essentially, a miracle. The shocking capacity of the Yugoslav state to integrate all of the different ethnic groups from the ruins of Austro-Hungarian rule has exceeded even the most optimistic prospects for the young nation. Unified under their Pan-Slavic identity and forged in the fires of Great War, Yugoslavia still has to choose its own destiny. Among occultists, technocrats, and nostalgics of bygones centuries, who can say where the future of the South Slav lies?"

#Focuses
YUG_heyslavs:0 "Hey Slavs!"
YUG_heyslavs_desc:0 "The 1931 coup changed Yugoslavia. Whether it's for the better or worse, it doesn't matter that much. Vladimir Dvorniković united both the right and the left in order to overthrow the inept King Aleksandar and uphold the idea of Yugoslavism. However, the country has been waging a silent war between the three sides for a long time. Even if ORJUNA and Zenit hailed Dvorniković as their Vođa, not everyone is happy with his controversial decisions. The situation recently escalated when Dvorniković took steps to increase his powers and was accused of tyranny because of it. Since then, several purges have been carried out and it is only up to the opposition's attitude whether Dvorniković will be able to survive and continue his rule."

YUG_modernauthoritarianism:0 "New Kind of State"
YUG_modernauthoritarianism_desc:0 "Our mission is of importance unparalleled in history. Each man, woman and child need to know their role in it. What dangers lie in small minds of our enemies! What destruction can their clumsy hands bring in their hatred and jealousy! But enemies outside of our borders are nothing when compared to those within them. Reactionaries, communists, those who hate light we bring and those who want to dwell in darkness. What would we be if we couldn't protect ourselves from them? We need to find and remove those degenerates like we remove disease or else entire organism of the nation shall become ill."
YUG_modernperun:0 "Modern Perun"
YUG_modernperun_desc:0 "Vođa Dvorniković like Perun transforms our nation. His striking hand sweeps away all our opponents like a thunderbolt. Thanks to the wisdom of our leader. The power of lighting holds no secret before us, sounds of nature serve us.

After the overthrow of this fool Dvorniković, our great leader Ljubo Leontić will be able to bring Yugoslavia back to normality.

YUG_vedicsystem:0 "Merciful Hearts"
YUG_vedicsystem_desc:0 "ORJUNA is an organization of the Yugoslavs and we serve everyone who wants to support our cause. Despite the fact that we are have a military structure, this country should be for the people. Our hearts must be warm to everyone who asks for our help. We guarantee equality before the law as well as economic equality. An ordinary citizen will not suffer under our rule, but we will fight any naughty desperate who wants to hurts our brothers and sisters."
YUG_purgetheinternationalavantgarde:0 "Monument of Centuries"
YUG_purgetheinternationalavantgarde_desc:0 "Our state needs grandiosity and splendor. We are going to give it. Let great military parades fill our cities. Buildings pile up. Pride in being Yugoslav flourished. Let the earth tremble under our feet and let the sky roar with our cannons. Our younger generation should be aware of what to be proud of and what to avoid. We must build a responsible and heroic society that will not sit on its laurels but will always be ready to defend what is right. We will build a new monument, more durable than bronze, which will last for centuries."
YUG_freeeaglesofthefatherland:0 "Firm Hand"
YUG_freeeaglesofthefatherland_desc:0 "Our governments are filled with militarism, arrogance and obstinacy. We want good for our people, but we are in a dangerous time that requires controversial methods. We will guarantee freedom, but also obligations for our people, such as loyalty to the leader and the state. We will restore freedom of speech and freedom of the press, but any book deemed propaganda hitting our nation and offending our values will be censored. Our hearts are low that we must become monsters, but the situation demands it, and we cannot show either pity or weakness."
YUG_nationalmysticism:0 "Corporative Democracy"
YUG_nationalmysticism_desc:0 "The French Revolution guaranteed people hope for a better tomorrow. We're not going to turn it around. Democracy is a wonderful and interesting experiment - even a holiday that engages every citizen to be interested in the affairs of the state, therefore democracy is something desirable in our country. However, modern mass democracy or liberal democracy is a perversion of this beautiful system. Praise not quality but quantity! Citizens feel that their voices doesn't count. Taking an example from these damned Italians, we will promote democracy within the corporations and in the class interest."
YUG_mythofbarbarians:0 "War on Capitalism"
YUG_mythofbarbarians_desc:0 "Capitalists and the financiers threaten the economic stability of our people. We need to repair our system again. We will raise workers' salaries. We will reduce the working time. We will liberalize the national market and allow domestic entrepreneurs to survive.

YUG_nacionalnaavantgarda:0 "Well-intentioned Terrorism"
YUG_nacionalnaavantgarda_desc:0 "As it was said - not only the young society, but also the older one, must defend what is right. Despite some liberalization of life, we cannot become weak. By cooperating with the socialists and democrats, we will actively fight all conspiratorial activities against our nation. Every seperatist or Italian agent should expect that a heavy but fair hand of the right will reach him and punish him."
YUG_slavicsyndicalism:0 "Order and Harmony"
YUG_slavicsyndicalism_desc:0 "The whole nation sings with one voice - the voice of reason and willingness to restore what is broken. The balance between freedom and duty creates in a non-invasive way people who want to fight for our country and at the same time are not afraid to express their own opinion. Our modern Democracy of talent and innovation is the pride of our nation. By continuing our activities, we will be able to guarantee good living conditions for every Yugoslav within our borders and abroad."
YUG_socialandnationalorder:0 "National Mysticism"
YUG_socialandnationalorder_desc:0 "Mysticism will not be a domain of feeble old loners tripping over their own beards and the matter of only the spiritual sphere. Religion creates a union between the idea and the people. Our Holy Yugoslav Cross and our Holy Yugoslav nation will be a matter for every soul in our country. It will be a matter of national importance. Contact with the divine will not be reserved for those shunning the world. Our future depends on the spiritual health of our every brother and sister. Proper rites, proper rituals, proper knowledge: this is what evey man, woman and child will take part in. We will be a nation united by the divine bond."

YUG_to_rape_europe_desc:0 "For centuries Europe has always tried to ridicule, enslave and break us, but we, the Balkan peoples, have never surrendered in our unholy struggle. Time for our revenge, time for Europe to feel our desire to annihilate it all. Dimitrije Mitrinović and Zenit will lead us to the glory and wildness of the peoples of the East. The vanguard of soul and body will show the true Nietzschean spirit who was tormented by the rulers of Babylonian Tyre. The future will come from the Balkans!"
YUG_eclipse_over_zagreb:0 "Eclipse Over Zagreb"
YUG_eclipse_over_zagreb_desc:0 "The Croats were traitors and puppets of the West, but we'll say the end of it. We will tear the hearts of these reactionaries and a real Serbian man will crush the neck of Zagreb's serpent. No more gothic cathedrals and no more Croatian "culture". Croats have always tried to introduce treacherous ideals into our country like "liberalism" or "traditionalism" and their politicians collaborated with Italy. We will put an end to this foul activity. It is time to prepare for the Rape of Europe and the destruction of the Croatian threat will be a good start. We will set one supranational Balkan culture modeled on the wild-hearted and the purest Serbian nation."
YUG_avant_garde_spirit_mind:0 "Avant-Garde in Spirit and Mind"
YUG_avant_garde_spirit_mind_desc:0 "Our goal is to transform all of Europe into one beautiful metaphysical utopia. The yugoslav structure introduced by Dvorniković was a good step towards this utopia, but what is mind education without education of the heart? We will educate a new generation in both poetry and science, as well as educate their bodies so that they can defend our homeland against the degenerate West. Like ancient orders, we will only accept the most faithful and passionate individuals into the ranks of the ruling elite. Our ruling front guard must be both strong in body and spirit to lead the Balkans to true enlightenment."
YUG_legacy_of_bogomils:0 "Legacy of Bogomils"
YUG_legacy_of_bogomils_desc:0 "Christianity is a puppet of Rome today, but this was not always the case. Once upon a time, faith in Christ focused on the simplest and wildest elements. Bogomils wanted to continue true Christianity until they were killed by traitors from Rome and Constantinople. We will return to Gnosticism and Bogomils faith, wanting Barbarogenija to be filled with the spirit of Christ. Mitrinović also proposed introducing the elements of Hermeticism into our new barbaric faith, arguing that transcendence is best achieved through the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus. Our Lord created us and we should thank him for that."
YUG_forward_to_sumatra:0 "Forward, to Sumatra!"
YUG_forward_to_sumatra_desc:0 ""I also saw the Moon, glistening, and I smiled inadvertently. He is the same everywhere, because he is dead."\n\nSumatra is not only a land in Asia but also a state of mind. Love not only for your life, but for everything that is alive and that surrounds you. Apathy is death. Death is no change. Our country must be constantly prepared for change in order to be able to achieve one overriding goal, which will be the harmonization of our entire existence. Nature and man. God and being. It will all exist in one harmony."
YUG_free_eagles_of_balkans:0 "The Free Eagles of the Balkans"
YUG_free_eagles_of_balkans_desc:0 "How can we release our spiritual and creative energy being pinned down by such a multitude of tasks, duties, prohibitions, orders ... A real Nitzscheanist is able to overthrow the entire system and we should strive for such a state. Anarchism, however, is an ugly idea that degenerates both mind and body. If we want to renew the Balkans in the spirit of modernity, we should reject the orders and leave the state at the same time! We will be a truly libertine realm in which everyone will work towards achieving a metaphysical utopia."
YUG_hang_the_lords:0 "Hang the Lords"
YUG_hang_the_lords_desc:0 "Divine order rules all things. From laws of nature, to laws of men. Society is also governed by those laws and our duty is to enforce them. Punish the guilty, protect the innocent, humble underserved pride and elevate virtue. With our rule established we are going to introduce equality in work, in thought, in spirit and in passion. For too long, landlords and the bourgeoisie have stood in the way of utopia! We will hang their withered flesh swollen as a warning to all those who oppress these little ones."

YUG_barbarian_mythos_desc:0 "Our boiling hearts full of unreasonable passion call us to do something about our reality and to realize our dreams. How long we were kept down by the old inept and boring men that couldn't create anything good, beautiful or creative! Feel your anger my dearest! As we need to punish them to create a new reality so use your anger my dearest! Take your knife and kill them and make them cry for the misdeeds they did to the weakest, the poorest and us! A true barbarian doesn't care about meaningless talk but uses his fanatic heart to destroy what is evil and wrong! That's how our society should look like!"
YUG_reconstruct_social_structure:0 "Reshaping of Society"
YUG_reconstruct_social_structure_desc:0 "Both Mitrinović and Micić are socialists, but not some ordinary people who see the end of human existence in matter, they believe in something more. They praise the wildness of the Bolsheviks and, at the same time, the freedom of the Fabians. Our state is fueled by these contradictions. We have no mercy for capitalists by punishing them as Lenin commanded and at the same time allowing freedom in planning and promoting dynamism. Bogdanov is too delicate in his postulates towards the bourgeoisie, while H. G. Wells, despite his good intentions, is romanticizes liberals. Each person with his change of soul will become a true socialist at heart."

We want something new, better… Bigger! As for us - The barbarians every place is too small and we want to conquer and reforge everything we meet. So we should honor the new man! As Yugoslavia is something greater, it's a realm of Barbarians we shouldn't call it simply a slavic state but §RBARBAROGENIJA!§!"

YUG_warisslavicculture_desc:0 "The culture of the Slavs has always been filled with war. Our ancestors perfected the wheel and, thanks to their horses, plundered the steppes, wreaking havoc and chaos. We invented the knife fight and our soldiers were the first to charge the enemy without fear, and the Italians, like the fearful thieves they are, appropriated our culture to adapt it to their own dirty games.

We should save our people and maximize the benefits and minimize losses. Therefore, our soldiers must inflict heavy losses themselves, sustaining small ones, and the front must always move to our advantage.

YUG_mechanization:0 "Mechanization"
YUG_mechanization_desc:0 "We need more than small arms, we need great hulking metal beasts to shield our way across the land. The rumbling of our engines translates to the quaking of our enemy in their boots. Imagine, fifteen armored men charging like Strahinja Banović to rip out our enemies' throats. We have to gain favorable positions and enemy positions as soon as possible, therefore the development of mechanized infantry will be necessary for our domination."
YUG_karlovacosjekline:0 "Karlovac-Osijek Line"
YUG_karlovacosjekline_desc:0 "The best offensive is a good defense. We will build a line of forts between the towns of Karlovac and Osijek. This will stop potential Italian and Austrian aggressors who might want to attack our positions from the north and west. Our defense will be tougher than rock, and no one will be able to break it.

YUG_undergroundproduction:0 "Underground Production"
YUG_undergroundproduction_desc:0 "Our opponents should be afraid of our weapons, but they should not know where and how we produce them.

It would be a great sight for sure, but not for those who would find themselves under the iron horseshoes during his frenetic ride. We will invest in the development of tanks that have started to gain importance since the World War.

#Leader Descriptions
POLITICS_Dvor_DESC:0 "A King-Philosopher, a Messiah and a Vođa of Yugoslavia. During his studies in Vienna, he was inspired by the works of Comte, Mickiewicz, and Haeckel, creating an atypical philosophy of life combining elements of positivism and romanticism. Had fate been cruller to him, he may have died unknown - but perhaps God smiled upon him, with his theories finding fertile ground and his speeches soon attracting thousands of people.\n\nOn September 3, 1931, Prime Minister Stojadinović, who was counting on the stabilization, was killed by a Macedonian assassin. The Revolutionary front asked Dvornikovic as a charismatic leader to lead them - to which he gladly agreed, leading a swift coup barely a month later. Part of the newly formed SJNK wishes he would step down after dealing with the situation, but through grit and tenacity he holds on, in spite of his controversial reforms. Focussed around "Blood and Soil", totalitarianization and ruthless westernization, they met with concern of many - but for now his rule among the people is known by one slogan:\n\n\"One Vođa! One Race! One Yugoslavia!\""
POLITICS_Leontic_DESC:0 "A former terrorist and a pragmatist that will use all means for the betterment of Yugoslavia no matter the cost. During the Great War, he was active in the Yugoslav Committee in Italy and worked on the formation of the Adriatic Legion, and after the peace was signed he found himself active in many organizations - sometimes contradictory. He was one of the leaders of the ORJUNA - Yugoslav nationalists who gained popularity through their love-hate relationship with the Carnaro Regency.\n\nThe organization's popularity allowed it to become an important member of the 1931 coup d'état, establishing itself as the armed wing of the revolution. Ironically, despite its techniques, Leontić does not postulate totalitarianism, but even liberalization of the system by weaving democratic elements and creating a Yugoslav version of the Carnaro system. There is no question of federalization, however, as it is seen as weakening the national unity that has been so heavily paid with blood. For Leontić, only one thing matters:\n\n\"Unity or Death!\""
POLITICS_Mitrinovic_DESC:0 "A mysterious Faustian spirit among the philosophers and barbarians, a revolutionary mystic who wants to bring a Neo-Atlantis. Initially becoming involved in the activities of \"Young Bosnia\" - a revolutionary terrorist organization - he eventually ended up in London where he worked for the Serbian legation, avidly reading The New Age magazine as he did so, dabbling in the world of mysticism and esotericism. At the invitation of the artistic group \"Zenit\", he returned to Yugoslavia, where he began to work tirelessly within, he quickly found his place and became the political leader of the artists.\n\nAfter the 1931 coup, he quickly rose through the ranks of government. It was he who in 1933 suggested sending a legation to Sofia to propose creating a union between two countries, becoming a peacetime hero in the process. However, Mitrinovic such worldly stardom is beneath his goals, because only one thing matters to him: \n\n\"To achieve the realm of dream!\""
POLITICS_Ljotic_DESC:0 "A slayer of the false prophets and a pious supporter of Ancient Rights, Ljotić was born in 1891 as the son of influential politician Vladimir Ljotić. From the beginning, Dmitrije was deeply pious, identifying with the great writer Tolstoy, and joined the Serbian army upon the breakout of the First Balkan War. After the conflict ended he left for France, meeting the works of Charles Maurras, who completely dispelled any remnants of the pacifist Tolstoyan spirit. Upon the conclusion of the Great War, he became Minister of Justice, but swiftly found himself at odds with the King, who roundly rejected his proposal for a constitution.\n\nAfter the coup Ljotić found himself in a difficult situation, forcing him to join the royalist underground and slowly creep his way back into politics. After the overthrow of Dvorniković, Leontić took a gamble - allowing Ljotić to come to power, then attempting to depose him. However, Ljotić does not intend to keep power to himself, instead waiting for the king with anticipation; he serves not in his own name, but:\n\n\"In the name of the King and God!\""
POLITICS_Karadordevic_DESC:0 "To some he is only a puppet in the hands of Chetniks, to others he is a benevolent ruler that helped finish the mad episode in the history of Southern Slavs. Following his service in the Great War, he grew close to King Aleksandar, advising him in a great many matters - indeed, all but his pro-Croatian views found welcoming ears in the King.\n\nPavle was one of the few members of the royal family who could remain in Yugoslavia after the 1931 coup alongside Đorđe Karadordević - but he spent most of his time engaged in fishing, not politics. Pavle was not the first candidate to the throne, but due to the conflict of his cousin Aleksandar I with the coup leaders and Yugoslav society in general, he fell out of favor and remained in exile with his family - paving the line for Pavle to the throne. Dmitrije Ljotić believes that his King will be able create a true Tsardom of Yugoslavia under a Royal motto:\n\n\"One People, One King, One State!\""

His sky-blue eyes scolded all demagogues as blond hair with a few strands of white hair was covered with a dictatorial cap and the symbol of Kolovrat. His perfect Dinaric jaw kept opening and closing, criticizing the entire congregation.\n\n\"...I expect nothing from you but discipline, zeal and more discipline! It is inconceivable that you wish to stop at our revolutionary task. We should continue our work not only for our benefit, but for all Slavic brothers! When did the ruin of Yugoslavia begin? It happened when the Italians and Austrians poisoned our souls and broke us. Therefore, it is unacceptable that this situation should repeat itself. I am not saying these words because I want to punish you, but they are words of caution to you, because among you there are false prophets who want to destroy us and our nation by resurrecting reactionary beliefs of magic and peasantness and tribalism nationalism by destroying the dinaric race. Don't be fooled by them because otherwise our national revolution will wipe you off the face of the earth!\"\n\nThe hall was filled with outstretched hands in the Roman salute and with shouts of \"Slava Dvorniković!\" when Vođa Vladimir Dvorniković was slowly coming down from the podium. Despite the words of praise and gestures of respect, not everyone was satisfied with Vođa's bold speech. Miloš Crnjanski straightened his tie and was also slowly getting up from the table when a man dressed in a uniform approached him. Dobroslav Jevdević recognized him as the head of the paramilitary wing of SJNK - The Action Section. He got up from the table and shook the officer's hand. Jevdevic motioned for him to sit down with a quick movement of his hand, because he had to talk with him.\n\n\"Good day Mr. Crnjanski. What do you think about the speech of our pious, generous, brilliant Vođa?\" \n\nCrnjanski laughed, sensing the sarcasm and irony in his interlocutor's voice, and added. \n\n\"I can say that I was knocked off my feet. I just don't know if it was because I couldn't stop laughing or if it was so shocking.\"\n\nJevdević laughed as well, but his expression was instantly more serious. He leaned slightly over the table and continued. \n\n\"No matter if this man had enough charisma to unite the whole brothel under him or not, he is a madman out of touch with reality. I hope Zenit, like the Orjunaši, is aware of this because it can lead to many unpleasant consequences for our factions. Therefore, I would like to ask-\"\n\nCrnjanski cut him off with a slight scowl. He didn't trust ORJUNA, just like Dvorniković, so he spoke sharply.\n\n\"About an alliance between our organizations. Yeah, yeah. I will say that Mitrinović wanted such an alliance but I assure you that it will be temporary and when the power vacuum after Dvorniković appears, we will throw ourselves at each other's throats\"\n\nJevdevic nodded, then sat back down in his chair, not wanting the meeting to look too suspicious.\n\n\"So, I understand we have a deal? Yes?\"\n\n\"Yes, but we'll talk about the details another time because it's too loud here and I am a quiet man, but apart from that, the walls here have ears, so be cautious and don't chatter left and right about our secret deal.\" \n\nJevdevic winced a little at these words, but he understood the point. He looked at his watch and without a word walked away from the table on the way to the exit. He only looked back to see that Crnjanski had disappeared into thin air."

yugoslavia.3.desc:0 "It would seem that the road to the Unitary and National Republic is open, but something has happened that no one expected. Leontic woke up today surprised as he was the one who had been summoned to Belgrade for the sudden deliberations of corporate members. He did not expect such a situation, as he announced a state of emergency until the situation in the country stabilized. He had a bad feeling about this sudden meeting, but immediately showed up with his bodyguards to protect him in case of emergency. His confusion was only deepened when he saw that it was not a trap, but that the meeting was in fact going on when he entered the room. He saw many familiar faces like Bulat, Jevđević, Ujević and others, but also new ones like Aćimović, Jonić and Muścicki. However, another figure stood out the most, taking the second most convenient and visible place - Dimitrije Ljotić. There was a second seat next to him and he motioned Leontić to sit next to him. Leontic immediately rushed to him and then asked him.\n\n\"What is going on here?\"\n\n\"We are discussing some matters. They may hurt you, but the sooner we get over it, the better for all of us. So sit back and don't be afraid. Nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\"What? What do you mean by this? Answer me!\"\n\nLeontić jumped up, but Ljotić indicated with his hand that it was unnecessary. This symbol convinced Leontić that the dice had been cast. He sat back down in the chair and Ljotić got up and started a short speech.\n\n\"We are gathered here to discuss one of the major changes. Our friend, Ljubo Leontić, served the Slavic brothers faithfully and defended the oppressed against ultramodern madness. He will be rewarded for this effort, but we will certainly agree that we cannot stop merely from changing one person to another. We must touch the hearts of our people and return to our glory days. We need a radical transformation of our nation, which I am going to guarantee. We are gathered here because I want to raise the subject of the next change of power, because I believe that we should save our country from godless communism, liberalism and futurism. Let me ask you a question. Will you support me in this holy task?\"\n\nAfter a short murmur, to Leontić's horror, who was watching everything with the greatest attention, all the people in the crowd slowly shouted, \"I'll help!\" Not only the Chetniks whom he invited to join the government, but also his friends. Ujevic stood up immediately and shouted enthusiastically as he often changed sides in a political conflict. Seeing this, Bulat stood up as well. Only Jevđevic thought for a moment, but also stood up at last. Seeing the lack of opposition, Ljotić added one more word which struck Leontić like a nail stuck in a coffin.\n\n\"If no one is against, I will replace our friend Leontić, who will be dismissed, and I, not as Vođa, but as Holy Regent, promise you to restore the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and bring back the king that we need.\"\n\nAfter these words, everyone cheered, and even Leontić, who was only sitting from the whole meeting, finally got up, remaining silent, knowing that this was the best scenario in this situation for him."

Please tell me what you've been doing lately.\"\n\nDvorniković started by speaking in a sweet voice. Leontić dared to answer the words in a calm voice. He put his hands folded on the table and began to speak.\n\n\"The Action Section successively dealt with the last remnants of the reactionary activity in Serbia and we are preparing several dozen operations on separatist nests in Croatia and Bosnia\"\n\nDvorniković listened patiently to Leontić's speech, but the constant tapping of his fingers on the table did not do any good. When Leontić was done, Vođa Dvorniković got up and slammed his fist on the table, then pointed his finger accusingly at the head of Orjunaši.\n\n\"BULLSHIT! So you tell me that you are either so inept that the monarchists have managed to send some poisoned letters to me, or that your boys are planning some kind of attack on me. Mr. Leontić. You tread on thin ice and I demand an explanation from you!\"\n\n\"I assure you that these letters didn't come from ORJUNA and Vođa should inform us of these cases so that we can-\" \n\nLeontić continued in a calm voice, until he was interrupted. Dvorniković did not want to listen to this idiocy, he only put both his hands on the table and then turned to Mitrinović looking straight into his eyes.\n\n\"And what about you Mr. Mitrinović. What have you been doing lately?\"\n\n\"I organized several cultural projects with Ljubomir Micić. We wanted to open an exhibition at the National Museum.\"\n\n\"And I assume that this new avant-garde exhibition required a chest full of weapons given to you by the Bulgarian commies? Are you making a fool of me? Our soldiers seized crates full of weapons kept in the museum's warehouses. Additionally, to add spice to the situation. They claimed that Action Section members checked the crates and found nothing suspicious. What are you guys playing at?\"\n\nMitrinović and Leontić were sitting, not knowing what to say, and Dvorniković himself went to the window and opened the blinds with his hand gently and then said:\n\n\"Belgrade is beautiful at night. I have done so much for our nation and you want to betray me and bring a catastrophe to our nation for what? Your petty interests and conflicts?\"\n\nHe sighed heavily, then the door banged open and a squad of soldiers entered the room and stood at the table.

In some parts of the country they did not yet know that Dvorniković was rotting in prison, and many loyalists were still in hiding. Leontić sat in his office wondering about the government's further tactics. His ultimate goal was to create an integral democracy that would be stable to keep all nations in check while avoiding a tyranny similar to that planned by the would-be totalitarian Vođa. He met with many representatives of opposition parties - both communists and democrats, but today he had a really interesting meeting planned. Velibor Jonić, a member of the former king's court, a teacher at a military academy and also a member of the Chetniks, more specifically the ZBOR party. Leontić collaborated with Chetniks and was afraid that now that Dvornikovic was overthrown you would want something from him. The soldier opened the door and Jonić entered the room. Leontić showed him a seat opposite his desk. Before Jonić took his place, he took off his hat and hung it with his coat on the hanger.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Jonić. How are you?\"\n\n\"In great mood, sir. I am really glad that ORJUNA freed our country from this psychopath. And also that we can finally come out of hiding, because we don't have to fear reprisals. I might criticize this familiarity with communists and liberals, but not the time and place for that.\"\n\n\"Yes I'm also glad that we succeeded, but could we proceed to the topic? I don't want to be rude, but I really have a lot on my mind lately and I have to restore order because other countries are slowly noticing the lack of Dvorniković's speeches.\"\n\n\"I just came in on this topic. Our mutual friend, Dimitrije Ljotić, suggested to me that you might need our help once again. You know, many citizens miss the monarchy, so returning familiar faces could help stabilize your government. The soldiers would be confident and the people would be calmer that you did not want to continue Dvorniković's madness.\"\n\n"I see what you are proposing... It is a dangerous offer, I must say and I do not know if I will not have to consult and discuss it. We have cooperated with you before, and I know your environment, and you would be a good solution, but I do not know if I can trust you. I'll think about a proposition, but for now I think we'll have to end the meeting.\"\n\nSaid Leontić, and Jonić got up from his chair, nodding his head. He spat a laconic \"I understand\", then headed for the door and said goodbye to Leontić. Leontić pondered the proposal made to him, and finally, after some reflection..."

Members of the so-called IMRO, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, killed about ten people and injured twice as many when one of the members of the organization planted explosives under the Old Bridge. Some witnesses said the explosion could even be seen from across the other side of the city. Bulgarians had tried to infiltrate our structures beforehand in order to weaken the potential threat that we might allegedly pose to them but these attempts were not that bold. The perpetrator was Arthur D. Howden Smith, a Bulgarian citizen of American descent. It is obvious that Stamboliyski denied funding IMRO on the grounds that the organization had reactionist and anti-socialist roots, so it would be foolish to assume that Smith was collaborating with Sofia.  \n\nBut even if Stamboliyski is right we should use this attack and put pressure on Sofia that we would be able to pass more radical bills and centralize power, thanks to which we will gain more control over Bulgaria's domestic policy and we will be able to integrate it.

Airplanes flew over them in the shape of a kolovrat - the symbol of Yugoslavia. After the planes had passed through, an artillery salvo sounded throughout the city. This was the signal for Leontić to go to the podium and begin his speech.\n\n\"Dear brothers and sisters! New Yugoslavia is born of the common sweat and blood. Together, we have built a great new army worthy of such a beautiful country as ours! Let everyone know that if there is a need to defend our homeland, every man, woman and child will work together to fight off the enemy! However, many South Slavs are still crying and asking for help abroad. The wicked attacks by Italians who attack our ships and murder our citizens show that we must act. I announce to all and sundry that if the government in Rome or Rijeka continues to oppress our brothers and sisters, it will face serious consequences!\"\n\nFirst there were murmurs of rage among the gathered civilians and soldiersbut after a while everyone would reach out in the Roman salute and shout together in one voice.\n\n\"Slava Vođa Leontić!

Truth has it that independence would mean nothing but weakening our great Homeland, opening the Dalmatian wound even further, potentially allowing the damned Italians to take the entire Slavic coastline. As for uniting all Croats under one banner - that has already happened. It's obvious their platform is a platform of chaos, disorder, disunity, and conflict. But that thorn ends today.\n\nWith the work of our glorious organization, we have located and infiltrated the last major Ustaše cell in the country. Located right next to Karlovac, near the Austrian border. The local ORJUNA cell has been dispatched to deal with it - and they did, posing as \"supportive locals\", delivering supplies for their cause. Little did the separatists know, the truck was wired to explode the moment its back door was opened. The driver and the passenger left it immediately after parking and retreated to a safe spot inside the compound. Just as they entered, an explosion rang. Those that stayed outside the compound pulled out their submachine guns and went into action, gunning down every Ustaše member they could see. Just half an hour later, the separatists got secluded to a small building, intending to use it in their last stand. After only fourteen minutes, the gunfire coming from inside it stopped.

Nikola Jokić, the strike's leader, along with his companions, announced their demands to the government, stating that the strike will not end until they're satisfied. This was bad. The entire arms plant was essentially defunct, slowing down the much-awaited modernization of the Yugoslav army. The government decided to act immediately, sending a team to deal with the workers.\n\nThe team of negotiators, led by Tin Ujević, immediately sat at the round table with the strike's leading figures, not knowing what to promise, what they can and cannot say, whether the government will accept the result of the meeting or not, and so on - they were sent here without much consideration, almost as if the negotiations were supposed to fail - and that's what Ujević feared - that the striking workers of the plant will be made into an example, decimated with an armed intervention, framed as socialists trying to break the Yugoslav nation apart.\n\nNonetheless, he made his attempt. Right off the bat, he told the workers they cannot count on all of their demands being fulfilled - something they already knew, yet held a spark of hope for success nonetheless. He asked for a written copy of the demands, and when he received it, he and his negotiator team went to work, analyzing every single point, thinking of methods of satisfying both sides with a compromise. The one point that caught his attention was related to democracy. ORJUNA wasn't exactly opposed to it, but claimed that there are more important matters right now. However, he didn't know how to tackle it - that is, until Jokić spoke.\n\n\"You know, Mr. Ujević, we are not opposed to that entire 'corporations' system you have got going. In fact, we quite like it - it binds us with solidarity, but we believe that for true solidarity, we need to have a say in it too.\" - he said. And that's when Ujević had a revelation. Democracy within the corporations was the solution. Although not directly listed as a demand, it was no doubt a compromise both sides were willing to accept - the government could adapt to its citizens, making our system organic, a true system of the Nation, and the people would choose the guides of their labor.\n\nHe talked this through with his team, all supportive of the idea, and presented it - this, alongside other, similar compromises, swiftly ended the negotiations, with the government itself deciding that the result is satisfactory, aiming to implement these reforms."

The rebel force was entirely decimated, save for a single soldier who was taken for questioning by the Zenitofori's hierophant. The soldier had bitten off his tongue during the night to avoid questioning, which led the Zenitofori to reconsider their plans for him. He was to be made an example of.\n\n\"You are brought before the ones you intended to slaughter just hours prior to our meeting.\" The hierophant's clear, zealous voice sounded through the field. \"Take a proper look at them.\" The hierophant had caught him by the hair on the crown of his head and lifted it up, so that he could see the crowd. His eyes were lucid, and his expression – unapologetic. A smirk passed through his left cheek as he spat out a gross, slimy spittle on the ground.\n\n\"So be it. I am offering you one last look.

This rotten heart that you have is just filling up space in your chest, you have no need for it. We shall offer it as a sacrifice, so that you could at least atone for your brothers' sins.\"\n\nThe Croat offered no reaction to the fact that he had just heard. He just stared blankly at some point in the distance. The executioner lifted his polished knife and directly plunged it into the man's chest, and a stream of blood came rushing through the hole. The hierophant took the executioner's place and immediately reached for the bleeding man. A hallowing shout pierced the fresh morning air as the hierophant severed the bandit's heart and presented it to the public, still beating.

The siege was led by a man called Hristofor, who desired to live up to his name, and bring the true word of Christ to the heathens. This is what it has come to. Even the word of Christ has managed to be twisted, mocked, dragged into the mud, alongside politics and mercantilism. This is not the faith that he was taught as a child, this is not our Balkan faith, but foreign incursion, an unnatural tumor that has poisoned the civilized Balkan man's heart and mind with its \"doctrines\". Pah! Hypocrites, the whole lot of them, subversive thieves, poisoners, deceivers. Annihilators of truth. Of course, there was some good to be found in their ramblings, since they were professing the faith of Christ after all, but it was so twisted and mocked at this point. We have suffered from them for too long, and we desire to suffer them not a second longer. They have been given ultimatums to convert to the true, Balkan, natural faith of Bogomilism - the true continuation of Orphism, and the true doctrine of Christ, unsullied by civilization, politics, and merchandry. Yet most of them have spat in our faces, completely unrepentant of their continuous crimes against our peoples. This one had barricaded himself in his shrine and left his loyal dogs of followers to come at us with their firearms, blast us into oblivion in defense of their priest's riches and deception - truly the \"essence\" of Christ's teachings. They were quickly subdued and taken care of. All that was left of the siege was the heavy door, laced with gold and steel, which was soon to be breached by the battering ram.\n\nWith one final, vigorous thrust, the gates were torn open, slamming into the walls of the church with a thunderous roar, which Hristofor picked up on as the crowd swarmed into the building. The terrifying howl of the muscular, roaring, bearded barbarian soon echoed across the until now, serene chapel. A ragged looking man from the crowd had picked up the trembling figure of the priest, holding him against the wall.\n\n\"I will tear you apart, filthy scum, look at what you've done with the Balkans! All of this devastation is the consequence of your \"Christian\" doctrines! Are you not at least ashamed?\" Frantically, he pulled out a knife from his belt and held it up to the priest's neck. Hristofor quickly intervened, and pushed the knife away.\n\n\"This would be enough, have we not what we came for? I trust this man will, despite his crimes, one day repent, for I trust that he is a good man in his heart.\" He turned towards the priest \"Go, and sin no more.\" \n\nThe ragged man let the priest go, and he, knowing that he was spared, regained composure, turned towards the crowd, said a quick prayer for them, and left with tears in his eyes. \n\nHristofor climbed up on the pedestal and began his speech\n\n\"Brothers, we are triumphant once again, for truth will always prevail, since it always exists, even under the veil of deceit. These men have corrupted and sullied the Balkan spirit for long enough, but they are not all wicked, and we must forgive them, for many of them have thought that what they did was best for us, and their institution has ultimately preserved our culture. This, however, becomes impossible in our current age of ideas, widespread literacy, ideology and change. The further they tighten the grip on our ideas, the more apparent their corruption, malice and sedation become. We're currently standing in a temple. Not a marketplace and not a marketplace, and we shall keep it so. Let us become like children again, unsullied by the baggage of civilization, unsullied by the baggage of polticised doctrine, usullied by the pretense of appearing cultivated. We are hot and cold, not lukewarm and we shall enter Christ's mouth. We have persisted, and we will persist. In the face of \"cultivation\" we bring forth barbarism. In the face of decadence and luxury, we bring our earnest hearts and honesty. In the face of politicised doctrine, we bring forth theologicized politics. In the face of water, we give our blood.\""

So the only right and best choice was - Pavle Karađorđević, not only a staunch Pan-Slavist, but also not as badly disposed towards Ljotić's ideas as Aleksandar.

The things which I have here before promised, I will perform, and keep. So help me God\"\n\nPavle and Olga said and Patriarch placed the crown on Pavle's head and then on Olga's head.\n\nAfter these words, there was cheering in the Church, and shortly thereafter one could hear cheers outside mixed with the sound of fireworks. Pavle and Olga smiled at each other and stood up to go out to the people gathered in front of the Church. When they opened the door together, one could hear one shout screamed almost with one heart."

yugoslavia.31.desc:0 "The Church of Saint Sava was supposed to be a great building, the view of which would dominate Belgrade and would be the pride of the whole of Yugoslavia, however, despite the official building permit, the government of Dvorniković often used the building to blackmail the Church. Once the construction did not meet the requirements. Once, suddenly, the government found contraband in the builders' chests. He once accused the Church of alleged meetings of monarchists around the construction site. And only if the whims of the government were fulfilled, the building could be painstakingly advanced. But now as the ungodly government of SJNK was overthrown, the building progressed at a fantastic pace. The building required some finishing touches, but the interior of the church was filled with beautiful paintings made by the best artists. Milan Aćimović, as the minister of foreign affairs, came to the construction site to admire the beauty of the ten-meter-high building. Aleksandar Deroko, one of the church designers, welcomed the minister and began to lead him around the construction site, then making sure that nothing would happen to the honorable guest. He showed the prepared icons that will be blessed and hung on the walls, as well as a plan of frescoes that will be painted on the church ceiling. Aćimović was delighted with the plans, but was still not sure if such ambitious plans would actually be realized. He gave the green light to continue the work long ago when the continuation project was presented to him, but foresaw that he had been invited due to some complication.\n\n\"So Mr. Deroko. Why am I invited here? I thought the church would be ready in a few years.\"\n\nHe said turning to his companion whom he asked.\n\n\"You see. I followed the example of Haghia Sophia, which is now a mosque, and I would like to make this church almost as great as Hagia Sophia. However, we do not have the resources to do so. Additionally, our builders discovered that some foundations are damaged and we suspect sabotage. We do not know if someone did it recently or if this devil Dvorniković planned to blackmail us once again, although repairing the foundations will take some time and we can fear that they have been contaminated with sugar.\"\n\n\"With sugar?\"\n\n\"It's a french anarchist technique. It was mostly used to destroy prisons but concrete can be prone to cracks.\"\n\nAltimovic thought about it and scratched his chin, then said.\n\n\"The villages are too much financed by Ljotić and the towns are neglected. The factories are in fairly average condition. Don't get me wrong, I am glad that the villagers have enough to eat and the mortality in the countryside has drastically decreased along with illiteracy, but we must not neglect our national pearls that are our cities! Which is why...\""

yugoslavia.32.t:0 "The Only Light of Our Life"
yugoslavia.32.desc:0 "Bosnia was the seat of Islam among the Slavs in the Balkans since the fifteenth century. Nothing seemed to change for a long time. The brothers held firm in faith in Allah despite the wars or the reluctant stance on the part of Austrians, Serbs or modernists from SJNK. Only now has that changed. When SJNK was overthrown and Ljotić's gang moved in, things started to change. Imam Munir Bajric prayed with the faithful for an end to the persecution of Muslims by his fellow Slavs. It was not a bloody persecution, as it mainly concerned buildings, but it also struck the soul of the faithful. Imams were arrested en masse and beautiful mosques were closed or turned into Churches. Then something unexpected happened. It was Salah time, and all the faithful and the Imam himself turned to Qibla, bowing when suddenly the screams of a man outside were heard. Some gathered at once stood, others finished their prayers and turned to leave. The men advised Imam Bajric to stay in the temple, as it is unknown what was going on. Despite this, he frowned and straightened his mustache, then curiosity won in him and leaned out the window to see and hear the voices of the Orthodox villagers of the village.\n\n\"Hide, hide! They are already here!\"\n\nFather Aleksandar shouted as he ran towards the mosque and waved his arm. The cassock was blowing in the wind as he approached the church. Imam Munir turned pale immediately and ran out of the temple to meet Aleksandar. He did not expect that when the Zborists came, the Imam would come out of hiding. Immediately a frown appeared on his face and he shouted at the Imam.\n\n\"What are you doing for god's sake!\"\n\n\"Aleksandar, I can't just hide for eternity. They won't kill me and I must stand in the name of my faith and my community\"\n\n\"So go to church then and hide under the rug. You will wait, you will leave, and you will be able to return to your damn rites!\n\n\"And what then? Someone will hand me over sooner or later, and not only me and my community will have problems, but the whole village! They'll arrest me for a few months or years, and the rest of the community will-\"\n\nThe imam could not finish because a truck arrived in the village and an officer of the ZBOR came out of it. Both priests turned to face them and hid their emotions. The officer left the truck with the rest of the soldiers and approached Munir. He covered him with his eyes, then said.\n\n\"By order of regent Dimitrije Ljotić, we have come to close one of the last mosques in Bosnia. I suppose I am dealing with Imam Munir Bajric now. Nice to meet you.\" The officer said, holding out his hand and Munir shook it in silence. The officer continued.\n\n\"I'm also here to arrest you Mr. Bajric. So I hope that you will not resist and you understand the seriousness of this difficult situation\"\n\n\"Yes I know my fate and I'm not going to resist it. Christ will come and show you your mistake of persecuting Muslims.\"\n\n\"Maybe, maybe no-\"\n\nThe officer smiled slightly at the imam's second sentence and wanted to answer it dismissively when a stone flew towards him. First one, then a second, and then a third. He managed to avoid a blow to the head, but the rock landed on his chest anyway, knocking him out of breath and knocking him off his feet. Muslims and neighbors began throwing stones at soldiers who wanted to close the mosque. The privates who entered the mosque were thrown down the drain, and quickly this small unit had to save itself, knowing that the use of weapons would amount to death. They only left an unconscious officer lying in the mud. The imam, furious seeing this, turned towards the crowd and shouted:"

yugoslavia.33.t:0 "The Crescent, the Cross, and the Poglovar"
yugoslavia.33.desc:0 "It was a sunny day in Zagreb when Đuro Vilović arrived at the nationalized Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Orthodox, Protestant, Catholic, he changed religion before he became a priest and did not guess that he would go that far. Thanks to the generous Vođa Dvorniković he will become Patriarch, Pope and Caliph, or rather Poglavar of the new Yugoslavist faith. He despised the old priests and imams for their restrictiveness, but Dvornikovic allowed him more freedom in matters of theology as long as he remained faithful to Yugoslavia. He knew that after becoming Pontifex he would allow some love in the Church. He loved women, they had such wonderful bodies and the Vicar of Christ and successor of Mohammed deserves a little earthly pleasure. He thought so as he got out of his car. He wasn't wearing some very rich clothes so as not to anger the Muslims who agreed to the whole undertaking. Vilović only wore a simple white garment modeled on the Patriarch's robes with a white crown. He had a black long beard reaching to his chest. The only thing that stood out was the symbol of the combined half moon and cross slung around his neck. He slowly entered the Cathedral, the stained glass windows of which were stripped of saints and filled with beautiful stained glass full of symbols representing these saints that served one true God. The Church organ resounded throughout the temple and the newly converted believers looked at the altar or Poglovar. A Massive Book was placed on the altar - Knijga. It contained the Quran and the Bible, but also Yugoslav mythology and the history of "saints''. The future Poglovar approached the altar and opened the Knijga on one of the sides. Vilović started reading it.\n\n\"Seven days of sunshine. Seven nights of blindness. Seven days and nights of planning, for there should be seven hundred and seventy-seven years of revenge for the Germanic captivity. There will be a tragedy. There will be a tyrancide. There will be blood. All in the name of Bog, said Saint Žerajić after he tried to put an end to the cruelty of the traitor Marijan Varešanin. The murder of the beast failed and Žerajić himself committed suicide, as he lived in freedom and wanted to die in freedom.\"\n\nEvery faithful, including Dvornikovic, Tesla and the rest of the SJNK government bowed their heads and fell silent at the words about the death of the Holy terrorist. Vilović closed the book and began a short sermon.\n\n\"Despite the sacrifice of Saint Žerajić and the hosts of other saints throughout the ages, the Slavs are still not united and their divisions are still exploited by nasty invaders. Today, however, we have taken a huge step for the sake of the unity of all Slavs. Brothers professing the same one god were united under one banner of faith. It will take a long time to convert all the lost to the righteous faith, but with our stubbornness, perseverance and unwavering faith we will achieve our goal. I need the same if we want to free these lost sheep from wicked Italians who still oppress our brothers and sisters, but as Poglovar I am going to support Vođa Dvorniković in this difficult task with all my strength and I hope you will help as well. As the Father in heaven wants only one thing from you! UNITY OR DEATH!\"\n\n\"UNITY OR DEATH!\"\n\nEveryone in the church shouted, and the ceremony continued. At one point, Poglovar went to the altar and fell on his face, and all the faithful with him. The Imam and two priests approached Đuro and together they drew the sign of the cross and the crescent moon on his forehead.. After that, the anthem was sung and officially Poglovar of the Yugoslav Church made another announcement."
