#BOOKMARKS
KOLCHAK_RUSSIAN_DESC:0 "The Murder of Nicholas II in Kiev stirred up Russia. The government of confidence led by Prime Minister Stolypin stabilized the country and withstood the Great War. But the war broke the spirit of the Russian people. The socialists along with the traitorous liberals plunged the country into turmoil. The collapse of the country was stopped through the efforts of the people who remained faithful to the oath. A decade passed and Russia has recovered. Alexander Kolchak holds the steering wheel firmly but the clouds thickened over Russia. Will the admiral withstand the coming flood or will the stream blow Russia to the rocks of History?"

I shall go to one of my properties away from Petrograd to relax myself from the cutthroat politics and gloomy weather here.There are several relaxing places I can visit on my vacation. All of them are different compared to Petrograd, but a somewhat closer destination might mean a safer journey...perhaps? "

russia.2.d:0 "Today, the famous writer Mikhail Bulgakov published a novel titled "The Prince of Darkness", work that he considers to be his greatest achievement.\nThe book, while having several subplots such as Jesus Christ being rejected by Jews and the struggle of a talented avantguarde poet against a conservative artist elite, is mostly known for strange element of the Devil-Woland showing up in Moscow. At first shown as all powerful evil entity, Woland is quicky locked up by corrupt police officers and later tortured by Okhrana. Once relased on the streets of Moscow, Woland is facing series of misfortunes caused mainly by the old tsarist administration. After several days in Moscow, Woland declares that even Hell is better and returns, saying Moscow doesn't need the devil so long as Kolchak is there."

russia.3.desc:0 "This vacation was everything Kolchak needed, and its end aggravated him. He was fishing along the Black Sea, relaxing and nearly falling asleep to the sound of waves crashing on the rocks. Then, in a flash, a squad of loyal army officers grabbed him and rushed him to their car. They had explained that they believed that Drozdovsky was attempting to assassinate him, and they had proof that anti-Kolchak agents disguised as anarchists had already raided his vacation home in an attempt to find him. Kolchak sighed, realizing that his short-lived vacation was now over.\n\nAs they drove through the streets of Yalta, desperately trying to reach the evacuation point at the airport, the driver realized they were being followed. As if on cue, shots rang from the following car, and the driver put the pedal to the floor and began to swerve. Loyalist officers in the back ordered Kolchak to get down, as they swung out pistols of their own and fired back, and friendly police cars started to attempt to intercept the assaulters vehicle. Drozdovsky's assassins swerved off, and for a moment, it looked like they were gone.\n\nThey arrived at the airport, and Kolchak and his men ran to the airplane parked on the tarmac. Out of nowhere, the car from before burst through the gates, and the driver quickly pulled out his gun and opened fire on Kolchak. As the bullet sailed towards him, one thought crossed Kolchak's mind:"

russia.4.desc:0 "\"It is with a heavy heart that I must announce that Alexander Kolchak, the Supreme Leader of all of Russia, is dead.\" Mikhail Drozdovsky declared over radio. The news was shocking; wasn't he just on vacation? \"Yesterday at 2:00 in the afternoon, Kolchak and his men were attacked at an airport in Yalta by anarchists loyal to those bastards in Germany, and they were all killed in the ensuing firefight. In his place, I shall take over.\" This was believed by some, but challenger were already coming out of the woodworks. Ivan Romanovsky, a fellow general, declared that he had evidence that the \"anarchists\" were, in fact, agents of Drozdovsky, and that the people of Russia now needed to rally against him and his regime.\n\nThe military is split right down the middle on who to support. The navy had always been a pro-Kolchak stronghold, as he had been a naval officer and had invested heavily in upgrading the navy. The army, on the other hand, is strongly in favour of Drozdovsky, and many generals believe that sucking up to him will be better for getting spending in the long run. These divisions are going to be influencing our politics for years to come, it seems."

russia.5.t:0 "Kolchak Exposes Drozdovsky"
russia.5.desc:0 "\"People of Russia, so fair and wise in your habits and traditions. Let me ask you; what is worse than a mere enemy?\" Kolchak asked over radio. He had miraculously survived an assassination attempt a day ago thanks to the sacrifice of the squad's leading officer, who jumped in the way of the bullets to save him. \"What's worse is a traitor! A backstabbing, snake in the grass, good for nothing traitor! And I know of one in our ranks; Mikhail Drozdovsky.\" He further alleged that Drozdovsky had disguised his men as anarchists in order to divert blame, and was attempting to make himself Supreme Leader of Russia.\n\nDrozdovsky has challenged these claims, and has further asserted that Kolchak had hired anarchist partisans in an attempt to eliminate him. In response to all of this, the military is split right down the middle on who to support. The navy had always been a pro-Kolchak stronghold, as he had been a naval officer and had invested heavily in upgrading the navy. The army, on the other hand, is strongly in favour of Drozdovsky, and many generals believe that sucking up to him will be better for getting spending in the long run.

Armed groups have formed, proclaiming their loyalty to either Kolchak's government or Drozdovsky, and they've already clashed before over whatever happens to get them upset. But today, its gone violent; a Kolchakist clique in Moscow has gotten into a firefight with a pro-Drozdovsky group, ending with the Drozdovskists storming government buildings and proclaiming the current government illegitimate. Mikhail has joined these men, proclaiming himself the leader of the new Russia and has organized the army in order to defend the new regime.\n\nKolchak's supporters, on the other hand, have fled to Kazan, where they've established a new government in order to hold their ground and eventually take down the traitors. Now, the people must choose between the admiral and the general; the fate of Russia is in their hands."

The strikes were of course broken by our brave police forces and many of the ringleaders arrested for illegal striking but the Supreme Leader has taken personal interest in this affair, delcaring that the schism between the government and workers must be mended, by any means necessary. Two proposals were put forward by Kolchak's council; one which suggested we complete the crackdowns we should have done in Novemeber with arresting more of the organising workers, while another suggests releasing the less volatile leaders and allowing the Workers' Councils to reform, albeit under State supervision."

Then there is Prince Andrei Alexandrovich Romanov, cousin to the late Tsar Alexei II. The other two candidates are not Romanovs at all, in fact they are Rurikids. The Zemsky Sobor has seen fit to allow Russia the option to leave the name of Romanov behind it and choose from among the other royal nobles of the Empire. Princes Sergei Sergeievich Belosselsky-Belozersky and Alexander Sergeevich Obolensky represent alternatives to the Romanovs and the heartache that comes with memories of the civil war."

The Black Bloc has been setting up various antisemitic demonstrations and posters around Jewish communities across Russia with the goal of pressuring them to emigrate to a Jewish state.\nDespite the antisemitic demostrations and organisations the government has begun an even larger push for Jewish emigration, oftentimes making posters and setting up emigration offices near Jewish communities to promote Israeli migration. The government has also begun to crackdown and censor anti-zionist movements and promote and elevate zionist organisations, which has lead to further emigration to Israel.\nDespite the government seeing more success in these measures, small communities of Jews still remain throughout Russia, although the Government believes it has peacefully resolved tensions between Jewish communities and their slavic neighbours."

russia.24.desc:0 "The room is bathed in the sounds of music not yet heard under these vaults, vaults strictly classical, and at the same time subtle and luxurious - enough to hint at more. The music is bright, full-faced and ruddy-cheeked, like a young woman from a cloth hall, brave and impudent like a curly young man in a brand new fur coat, who deftly and boldly drives his three-horses chaise, and it seems like he will crush everything that will not be lucky to happen on his way. The music then falls, as if diving into the depths of the blue sea, and then soars, as if into the sky, deep, strong, but… quite old-fashioned.\nThis \"Russian dance\" is coming to an end, but the couples continue to waltz, and the sound of boots rings in the ears. In the center of the hall, on a shiny parquet, dancing beautiful pairs of mother-of-pearl and crimson silk - ladies in embroidered kokoshniks and old-fashioned sundresses (oh, how many seamstresses and shoemakers worked on them!), and gentlemen in high kaftans, girded with colorful belts. Lubochnaya greatness, as if the time of Alexei Mikhailovich returned, for a moment, from its bed, covered with a sable fur coat of past epochs - returned to hide in the folds of classical canopies and modern waltzes of French courtiers. Where have you disappeared, a beautiful epoch of peace and idyll! ... Here is the master of the ball, the old Count Turov dancing with his respectable, furry-sabled wife, himself like a boyar from the epics. Senior Turov, Sasha, a dandy and a fashionista, with a thin black mustache and a quick look, is nearby. His partner, the young Sofia Troekurova, a model of pure youth, not yet tarnished with the storm of life, completely languished. Maybe it is too hot in a heavy dress or maybe look of Sasha too sensual. They are a beautiful couple. Here is a thin and strict stereotype of the Ostsee German, Andrew von Wenkenbach, trying to look as always decent, but still embarrassed under the stubborn pressure of Countess Ukhtomskaya. The ladies whisper with smiles that the Countess seems to have decided to stop being an old maid, she flatters the embarrassed Mr. Andrew so much. Not everyone dances - junior Turov, Roman, stood without a partner and participate in the sluggish conversations between those who do not dance. He is not in his plate, he is squeezed by the collar of his kaftan, even this room is squeezing him, to be honest. Roman would rather be in Petrograd again, among his non-noble friends, rather than these disheveled antiquities. But whatever, he promised his father, it would be very bad to embarrass him and not show up. Eventually, he and Alina will need this damn money, sooner rather than later.\nAnd then the music fades again, and this time finally. The couples mix and go aside, while a servant comes out on the center, and solemnly announces:"

russia.25.desc:0 "Great portrait of Her Highness Tsaritsa Anastasia hang on the town hall tower. In fact four of them looked down on the town from each side of the tower like faces of ancient idols slavs build for their gods. There was no place to hide from Her soft, motherly gaze. She was beautiful. Youthful like spring but with knowing smile betraying wisdom of a woman beyond human age. Every detail of those massive portraits were in downright mathematical meticulousness chosen to soothe fears and anxieties of Her loyal subjects and bring fear in those hiding something from her blue gaze. Did she really look like that? Few really seen her up close. None would dare to deny. \n\nYuri sat in his chair, the old piece of bug-infested furniture creaked uncomfortably. He was a man in his late twenties but harsh winters and even harsher factory work gave him a face and hands of someone twice his age. Lack of sleep didn't help neither. But how can one sleep when there are leaflets to print? Truth to spread? None of this even mattered anymore. They knew what he was doing. They took Sasha yesterday. By now he told them everything they could ever want to know and more. How did they figured them out? Was there a traitor among them? None of this even mattered anymore. Yuri rested his tired face in his cold hands. He didn't even feel like crying. He didn't feel like anything. He just wanted it to be over with. He won't give those animals satisfaction of chasing him like a helpless rabbit. Chasing down prey is all they are good at. No sense in trying them. Those sick dogs like it. \n\nAt first there was this strange stillness. Untraceable air of incoming doom like that before a storm. But people still walked the streets, fat saleswoman still stood by her cart offering sweets to them. Children dressed in furry hats still stared hungrily at candy, their noses and cheeks red from the cold. Then the growl began. Monstrous, devilish noise made by packs of hungry dogs chasing after their prey. Primal and hateful, unfit for bustle of a city nor any place where civilized men dwelt. But also metallic and unnatural, not one any of God's creatures can make. But people on the street knew what that noise was. It was way worse than howl of a hungry wolf or laughter of Devil himself. It was song of motorcycle engines of Her Majesty's attack dogs. People moved aside. Some to make room for the incoming machines, some to press their faces against the wall and not see, not hear those black dogs, those hellhounds. \n\nRumors about them were too fantastical to believe but too frighting to ignore. They were dead warriors dug out of ancient kurhans and resurrected by some unknown science. They were demons bound by some saint into service to the crown. They were werewolves dressed like men and set to do government's bidding. They ate human flesh, they couldn't be killed by normal weapons, they bleed engine oil and fire. \n\nYuri heard the roar of engines. They were coming. They didn't worry he will run. No one will help him him. A man with Oprychnina on his back was a cursed man. The horde of savages clad in black leather, furs and animal skulls was able to sniff him everywhere and chase up to corners of the Empire. To help him was to sign your death warrant. To hide him was to condemn your family to prisons and worse. Yuri knew that they were after him. None of this even mattered anymore. \n\nWhen oprychniks barged into his room they only found a still fresh corpse hanging from a rope..."

As part of a sweeping wave of crackdowns on banned organisations, gangs, activists and even mere suspected left-sympathisers, the government has employed the military and extremist militias to maximise the purge. But they have now lost control, as the purge has progressed, certain groups of the Mladorossi, as well as the reactionary militias, have become more powerful than the government intended. With some factional fighting having broken out in Tatarstan, the two groups are now executing an armed struggle and are both threatening the internal stability of the Empire. Diterikh's populist militias and Aleksandr Kazam-bek's Mladorossi have grown into small armies in their own right. The Army has indeed reported rife defections, armouries have been raided, units dissolved and officers gone AWOL, the central government is now without the military means to end the conflict on their terms. So, with little appetite for yet more bloodshed among brothers, both sides have demanded an end to the hostilities before a wider war breaks out. The question is, who will Russia place it's trust in?"

Beginning duinrg the Summer War and now growing - emboldened by the state of emergency - radical elements have taken the opportunity to try and undermine the government and the army.\nWhile the purge on paper seems like an easy task to accomplish, in reality many of these socialists and revolutionaries are spread out and several have gone underground, making a purge with current resources a strain on the government. While many remain certain that the government will be able to handle the crisis, others aren't so sure, and have suggested to help deal with the socialist vermin that we recruit the help of more… radical elements. The support comes in the form of the Union of Young Russia, also known as the Union of Mladorossi or just Mladorossi, a party which espouses the return of the monarchy under a new ideology of "Tsar and Soviets". Another group that can support us is the followers of Mikhail Diterikhs whose radical Christian fanaticism can be of use in our purge.\nThere is some internal opposition to working with these groups, several ministers claim that by working with them, it might help legitimise their status in Russia and allow them to grow in influence, recreating a problem that the government set out to fix in the first place. However many others support and welcome their help as several government officials don't see the harm in allowing radicals to help purge socialist agitators across Russia. They view this as a way to contain the influence of both the Mladorossi and Diterikhs, and allow them to be used as tools of the government.\nWhatever choice will be made, one thing is for certain.

The Police responded too quickly, allowing many of the Strike orgainisers to flee and force a response from the Duma. While the Strikes have settled since then, they never truly ended as workers and police curse each other in the street. The Supreme Leader demands an answer to this tension."

RUS_dismiss_nechvolodov_desc:0 "Whatever General Nechvolodov's credentials, his overt anti-semitism and collaboration with the more extreme factions of the Black Hundereds is unacceptable of a State army officer.

RUS_subsidize_black_hundreds_desc:0 "While the Black Hundreds have some unsavory radical factions, they are at least nationalists through and through and the reality is that our government cannot stand alone in the face of rising Republican and Socialist popularity. By subsidising the campaigns of the Black Hundereds through fake organizations, we can improve their performance in the elections while keeping our own hands clean."

RUS_investigate_strike_desc:0 "The Republicans are opportunist snakes, this is certain, yet many whisper in Kolchak's ear that they are little more than Socialists with a lick of paint.

RUS_like_a_dream:0 "Like in a Dream"
RUS_like_a_dream_desc:0 "With Kolchak relaxing in Yalta and the Navy reporting excellent maneuvers in the Mediterranean, it seems that the future of Russia is bright like never before.

There will be little to stop our proud nation from asserting hegemony over the Balkans as we should have after the Great War."
RUS_ix_duma_election:0 "Elections in IX State Duma"
RUS_ix_duma_election_desc:0 "After a little break, it seems Kolchak is ready to return to business. Our previous efforts should make the Duma election a mere formality to secure a cooperative coalition of Black Hundereds and other noble nationalists within the Duma. Should anything unexpected occur, we have the Army and Navy to rely on, so a cursed revolution like that of 1918 can never occur again."

RUS_eliminate_malcontented_politicians_desc:0 "The Black Hundreds, the remnants of Bolshevism and Menshevism, and those dreadful Young Russians are all worryingly prominent in our political sphere. But their blind populism will be their end - as we find further and further successes their popularity will plummet."
RUS_cultural_authonomy_minorities:0 "Above Triune Russia"
RUS_cultural_authonomy_minorities_desc:0 "The Cossacks, Tatars, Kalmyks, Dagestanis and other minorities within Russia have long sought recognition and a reprieve from Russification policies.

RUS_ban_paramilitaries_desc:0 "The various militarised groups that have terrorised Russia for political gain since even before the 1919 revolution are at last abolished.

RUS_expand_power_duma_desc:0 "The era of despotism is well and truly over.

RUS_oligarchic_connections:0 "A New Face for Old Money"

RUS_toughen_penalties_desc:0 "What good are workers if they do not work? We must make it clear to those working class with their lofty ideals that the world cannot work like they wish it to. There is no alternative and our way is the only way. At the moment, there is far too much carrot, so they don't fear the stick - clearly a change is in order."
RUS_adjusting_structures:0 "Brass Choir of Industry"
RUS_adjusting_structures_desc:0 "The production line, which has been afforded great praise in Britain, America and elsewhere due to the increase in efficiency it provides, is simply not widespread enough in our factories.

RUS_destroy_populists:0 "Destroy Dangerous Populists"
RUS_destroy_populists_desc:0 "Russia has had a colorful history of political change and chaos, and one of the worst things to come out of that was the populistic forces of the left and the right. We must deal with neo-Revolutionary, neo-Menshevik, as soon as possible if we are to create a stable and wealthy Russia."

RUS_death_traitors_desc:0 "In our armed forces there are still enough of those who secretly disagree with the course chosen by Mikhail Gordeevich.

RUS_colonization_ostsee:0 "Baltic Settlement"
RUS_colonization_ostsee_desc:0 "Having occupied Riga, we have to strengthen our position in the returned provinces. Stimulating our specialists, loyal to the duty of saving Russia, to relocate to the newly acquired western governorate will help us tighten our grip there."

RUS_transsib:0 "The Great Siberian Way"
RUS_transsib_desc:0 "Before we carry out the long-awaited modernization of Siberia, we have to develop the railroad through the Urals.

RUS_siberian_wealth:0 "Siberian Wealth"

RUS_new_katorga_camps:0 "New Katorga Camps"
RUS_new_katorga_camps_desc:0 "With Siberia returned under our control, labour resources should be mobilized to accelerate the extraction of Siberia's natural reserves. Not everyone wants to voluntarily go to the cold taiga to cut wood or to the windswept quarries, but there are those who simply have no other choice and we can give them a chance to repent."
RUS_effective_exploitation:0 "Effective Exploitation"
RUS_effective_exploitation_desc:0 "Having put the extraction of minerals in Siberia on stream and built new factories in the Urals, our industrialists should work out methods for the most rational use of resources for the production of goods."

RUS_tuapse_poti_desc:0 "Paving a road in the mountains is not easy, especially if it's a railroad. However, with enough effort, we'll be able to make an impregnable fortress out of the Caucasus and anyone who wants to attack us from the south will have to think twice about it."

RUS_railway_boom:0 "Railway Boom"
RUS_railway_boom_desc:0 "One of the problems that Russia has always had is the roads. More precisely, their absence. However, technological progress gave us power over time and by the start of the XX century it didn't take months but days to get from Petrograd to Kamchatka. A network of railway tracks, immense like Russia itself, along which trains arriving at the station strictly on schedule will become the foundation on which the Fatherland will become greater than ever before."

RUS_plan_vostok:0 "Colonization plan Vostok"
RUS_plan_vostok_desc:0 "The slipping away of our rightful territory in the East is of great shame to our people and these sand-covered jewels must become an integral part of our nation once more.

RUS_resettlement_ministry:0 "Ministry of Resettlement"
RUS_resettlement_ministry_desc:0 "Sending colonists straight to the scorching sunlight and chilly winds of the steppes with only the clothes on their back is a recipe for disaster. Instead, a professional government ministry will provide structure and supplies to our brave frontiersmen."
RUS_take_land_and_water:0 "Take Land and Water"
RUS_take_land_and_water_desc:0 "But supplies from the central government can only go far - the colonists must learn to survive and thrive by standing on their own feet.

RUS_arm_colonists:0 "Arm the Colonists"
RUS_arm_colonists_desc:0 "The lands out east are wild, untamed and unpredictable. Danger lurks over every hillock and in every treeline, a danger posed by both beast and man. Providing them rifles will guarantee their safety and provide them a livelihood - hunting for meat and furs."
RUS_trains_land_of_opportunity:0 "Trains to the Land of Opportunity"
RUS_trains_land_of_opportunity_desc:0 "Travelling more than thousand kilometers into Central Asia is daunting enough for many to turn their noses up at colonist life, not even considering the prospect of scraping out a new life for yourself once you arrive, even with state support provided. Easing this journey with passenger trains will make Siberia far more accessible to the common people."
RUS_army_in_steppes:0 "Army in the Steppes"

RUS_neostolypin_reforms:0 "Continue Stolypin's Reforms"
RUS_neostolypin_reforms_desc:0 "Stolypin's reforms during the 1900s and 1910s did much to pacify the peasantry, limit the influence of the Reds and uplift the rural population out of conditions that had barely changed since the abolition of serfdom. By all measures, a tremendous success, and we'd do well to imitate that."
RUS_ministry_denominations:0 "Ministry of Denominations"
RUS_ministry_denominations_desc:0 "Russia is a land of many faiths, from Christianity in the heartlands, Islam in the Caucasus and Central Asia, as well as Buddism and even Pagan Tengrism in the Far East. Trying to convert them all would be a mammoth undertaking, so it would be better to set up a ministry to allow all faiths to live alongside one another in (relative) harmony."
RUS_primary_education:0 "Free Education"
RUS_primary_education_desc:0 "Under the Tsar, if you could read the alphabet and your own name, you were considered literate and eligible for army service - and yet more than half of the population couldn't do even that.

RUS_ministry_health_care:0 "Ministry of Healthcare"
RUS_ministry_health_care_desc:0 "Threat of illness, disease, and a slow and painful death always looms over one's head, be you a nobleman or a pauper. Inoculations, handwashing and other basic hygiene practices must be spread across the empire and be supported by government initiatives."

RUS_ministries_labour_security:0 "Ministry of Labour and Social Security"
RUS_ministries_labour_security_desc:0 "From the centres of cities to the farthest-flung fields, it would be hard not to notice the poverty in Russia. The Petrograd drinking dens in alleys and basements where the air is heavy and foul, filled with the detritus of society, the hay barges on the Neva where the tramps rest their heads and the muddy fields where peasants are worked to the bone in hand-me-down rags, trying to scrape together enough kopecks for a loaf of black bread. All of this must be done away with. The poor must still be incentivised to work, but making sure that they do not go to work on an empty stomach will do much to improve productivity."
RUS_league_russian_culture:0 "League of the Russian Culture"
RUS_league_russian_culture_desc:0 "What does it mean to be Russian? Is it Faith? Is it service to the Supreme Ruler? Is it a hardy spirit and tenacious will? Perhaps some nebulous mix of the three?

RUS_local_ministry:0 "Ministry of Local Administrations"
RUS_local_ministry_desc:0 "In a nation as vast as Russia, having one all-powerful central government in control of all the affairs of state is not a tenable position. Some level of devolved power will be necessary to maintain control over the far reaches and diverse peoples living under our reign. "
RUS_ministry_nationalities:0 "Ministry of Nationalities"
RUS_ministry_nationalities_desc:0 "Each ethnic group living in Russia has their own culture, tradition and inevitably, dreams of national liberation. Stymieing these movements by recognising and respecting the varied nationalities of our great nation and granting them a modicum of autonomy will take the wind out those dreamers' sails, securing our lands and making sure that non-Russians are invested in the continuation of the Russian state."
RUS_russification_intensifies:0 "Intensify Russification"
RUS_russification_intensifies_desc:0 "All people dream of being Russians. At least, that's what will be written on the posters that will soon be in every town and village beyond the Volga, the Don, and the Urals.

RUS_let_them_be:0 "Cultural Tolerance"
RUS_let_them_be_desc:0 "Service to Mother Russia is the most crucial requirement of being a citizen in our nation. Beyond that, frankly, it doesn't really matter.

RUS_crown_a_tsaritsa:0 "Crown a Tsaritsa"
RUS_crown_a_tsaritsa_desc:0 "The Mladorossi seek not a reactionary Tsar, nor a puppet nephew or cousin of the late Tsar Nicholas II. They will settle for no less than the last Tsar's sister Anastasia. From where the Mladorossi have brought her few are sure. Some claim she has been under their protection since 1920, others claim she is some imposter, dragged out of the shadows from some ambitious aristocratic family. Whatever the case may be, the crown is now hers, Tsaritsa Anastasia I. Long may she reign."
RUS_new_russian_man:0 "New Russian Man"
RUS_new_russian_man_desc:0 "We must place special emphasis on the moral education of youth, who will become the foundation of the new Russia.

However, it is we who must set an example for the younger generation and declare war on those forces that have rejected the sacredness of the spiritual aspect in the life of every human being!"
RUS_spiritual_guidance_of_the_party:0 "Spiritual Guidance of the Party"
RUS_spiritual_guidance_of_the_party_desc:0 "On their way, people may begin to doubt the correctness of their choice. There is nothing wrong with this, it is natural and should not be nipped in the bud. Instead, any representative of society, from a simple peasant to an urban intellectual, can always ask the party for advice on any issue and get an answer to it. Nothing gives confidence in your righteousness more than refuted doubt."
RUS_all_rusian_council_of_industry:0 "All-Russian Council of Industry"
RUS_all_rusian_council_of_industry_desc:0 "Since the coming of mass industrialisation, Russia has lagged behind the rest of Europe. The only way to alleviate this issue is a concerted effort between the central government and the local soviets to expand our economy and control the direction it takes, and to build up the industry our nation so desperately needs."
RUS_all_russian_council_of_agriculture:0 "All-Russian Council of Agriculture"
RUS_all_russian_council_of_agriculture_desc:0 "In order to never allow shortages and such terrible phenomena as famine, the state will take upon itself the responsibility of distributing benefits among the loyal subjects of Tsaritsa. The All-Russian Council of National Economy will be engaged in preserving the well-being of the population of the empire."
RUS_all_russian_council_of_army:0 "All-Russian Council of Army"
RUS_all_russian_council_of_army_desc:0 "The revolution of spirit has given birth to a new breed of Russian - courageous, heroic and capable of tremendous self-sacrifice. These new men, when organised into regimented divisions, will be able to free Russia of any pernicious foreign ideas or threats - so organise them we shall."
RUS_tsaritsa_and_soviets:0 "Tsaritsa and Soviets"
RUS_tsaritsa_and_soviets_desc:0 "Our dream has been realised - at the top, the gracious and beloved Tsaritsa Anastasia, her generosity unending and her will ferocious. Below that, the de-bolshevised soviets allow small communities to exercise self-government and manage local issues. These two elements, the Tsaritsa and the Soviets, now work hand in hand in a beautiful dance to bring our nation to soaring new heights."

#UNIFICATION FOCUSES
RUS_unify_empire:0 "Unite the Empire"
RUS_unify_empire_desc:0 "The time of troubles has passed. The old policy kept our hopes alive during our darkest years, but now many of the warlords we once had under our heel have declared their independence in defiance of Moscow. Bad news for them, however - Russia is not the limping, rotten mess that it once was, but instead is proud, mighty, and more than willing to reclaim what has been lost."
RUS_reintegrate_baltic:0 "Reintegrate the West"
RUS_reintegrate_baltic_desc:0 "The Baltic Sea will come under Russian hegemony again, announcing the new age of Russia. Finland and the Baltic Governorates reek of communist and nationalist partisans, but there are also loyal sons of Russia awaiting our return."
RUS_ultimatum_to_south_east:0 "Reclaim the Caucasus"
RUS_ultimatum_to_south_east_desc:0 "The fertile Kuban and the oil fields of the North Caucasus lie in their ineffective and weak hands. To save them from themselves, we must attack, and restore order. Even further, we shall at last cross the Caucasus and end the Bolshevik threat and the Armenian secessionists."
RUS_ultimatum_to_orenburg:0 "Reclaim Kazan"
RUS_ultimatum_to_orenburg_desc:0 "Kazan is the gateway to Siberia, to the whole East. The Miass river and the passes through the central Urals between Perm and Yekaterinburg are of the utmost strategic value. Mounting a conquest of Kazan is an essential first step in our push east to reclaim what is rightly ours."
RUS_retake_the_steppe:0 "Bring the Steppes Back"
RUS_retake_the_steppe_desc:0 "The vast steppes, though sparsely populated and with little industry to speak of, are nonetheless an important component of our geopolitical security. So long as there is flat, unobstructed land between us and our enemies, we are in danger - to alleviate this, the steppes of Central Asia must be under our control. With the Pamir to the east, the Caspian to the west, and the muddy, swirling currents of the Amu Darya to the south, our position will be immeasurably safer."
RUS_retake_siberia:0 "Retake Siberia"
RUS_retake_siberia_desc:0 "Siberia, for a long time Imperial Russia's penal colony, is a fabulously rich swath of land. Huge quantities of precious metals abound in the frozen tundra, with extensive old growth forest too. Ever since the modern Russian state was built by Ivan the Terrible in the 1500s, the domain of Siberia was ours and ours alone - and the plucky rebels currently squatting there would do well to remember that. Perhaps they need a reminder?"
RUS_secure_altay:0 "Secure Altay"
RUS_secure_altay_desc:0 "Sitting at the junction of the Siberian tundra, the Kazakh Steppe, and the deserts of Mongolia and Xinjiang, Altay is the border guard and the watchtower for the entire region. We would do well to bring it back into the fold."
RUS_ultimatum_to_yakutsk:0 "Reclaim Yakutsk"
RUS_ultimatum_to_yakutsk_desc:0 "As we follow in the footsteps of Yermak Timofeyevich and recreate the conquests of 400 years prior, we are a single step away from seeing the tranquil Pacific once again. Only Yakutia, with its esoteric sprinklings of the Japanese, old Russian seamen from the Pacific Fleet, and the indigenous Yakuts, remains in our way. By now, they will be well aware of our looming army, but we can make the choice easy for them - submit, or be swept aside."
RUS_crush_rogue_officer:0 "Hunt Down Semyonov"
RUS_crush_rogue_officer_desc:0 "Semyonov will at last be punished. Ever since the days of the Civil War, his own ambitions have only brought disaster, refusing to fully commit to our cause during Russia's darkest hour, then acting as a barrier to shield the vile Republicans. But now, it won't be the same. His fief and the TransSib will return to our control, and from there we will launch our final strike to Harbin!"
RUS_finish_zhelto:0 "The Last Clash with Republicans"
RUS_finish_zhelto_desc:0 "With the destruction of the Trans-Siberian Railway during the Russian Civil War impeding our ability to pursue them, the bastard socialists and their hangers-on managed to limp their way to Manchuria and pitch their tents in the Far East. But we and them have unfinished business, and now that we are at their doorstep, they ought to be trembling in their boots. Though their revolution failed, the embers have never been stamped out - and it's high time to correct that."

#POSTUNI
RUS_our_duty_to_order:0 "Our Duty to Order"
RUS_our_duty_to_order_desc:0 "Now that we have finished bringing together all our rebellious subjects, it is time to renew our holy mission to order and turn west. Since 1798, we have had a commitment to end every petulant revolution and we will maintain this task until Christ returns. So let us look at the situation in Europe to see who can be called on to do what must be done to end these defilers of Christ."
RUS_renew_pact:0 "Renew the Birchen Pact"
RUS_renew_pact_desc:0 "The entire reason we fight is for order and continuity, so why not return to what we know? Birkeneid remains the bastion of order and has only become more committed to the cause of tearing down the liberal lie since our recent troubles. United with our Nordic cousins, we will descend from the North to the South of Europe and wash away this false and decrepit modern man who believes himself to be enlightened. For his enlightenment is merely a candle to the forest fire of our ancient tradition in Christ."
RUS_a_road_we_walk_alone:0 "A Road We Walk Alone"
RUS_a_road_we_walk_alone_desc:0 "Once again we have been left abandoned by all our allies, left to stand completely on our own. All of Europe has fallen to the wave of revolution but it is of no concern. We are strong enough to tear down all of Europe completely alone. We did it in 1812, and we can certainly do it again. In fact, we welcome it since we will not have to share or compromise anything in our inevitable victory. Pure order will reign and it will reign for all time."
RUS_holy_alliance:0 "A New Holy Alliance"
RUS_holy_alliance_desc:0 "While the Birkeneid was a useful stopgap against the revolutions of 1918, we will need something more permanent to go on the offensive. We shall look back on our past and bring together the three bastions of, what our enemies sneeringly call, reaction to end the liberal wave. So let us return to 1815 and make a toast to a New Holy Alliance which will protect the divine right of kings against the falsely enthroned idea of constitutions and republics."
RUS_treaty_two_emperors:0 "Treaty of Two Emperors"
RUS_treaty_two_emperors_desc:0 "Unfortunately our Prussian allies have fallen to the siren song of liberalism, just as they did in 1805. But in losing one friend, we merely had a chance to gain another, as Austria has awoken from its slumber and a new Emperor who is truly up to the task of tearing down the revolution has stepped up to the plate. Let us create a treaty of friendship, a treaty which will shake the revolution to its bones and renew the ancient tradition in Europe."
RUS_war_russia:0 "War for Holy and Triune Russia"
RUS_war_russia_desc:0 "It is a misnomer to say Russia is united while Belarus and Ukraine fall outside her borders. Our first and most pressing task is to finish the unification of Russia and put down the source for its division: Warsaw. We will douse the foul "promethean" flame that emanates from the Lechitic Land and return to our proper territory before the tragic war of 1913."
RUS_anti_spartakist_crusade:0 "The Anti-Spartakist Crusade"
RUS_anti_spartakist_crusade_desc:0 "While the Intermarium disgusted us for occupying Holy and Triune Russia, Germany horrifies us. It openly declares itself against all that is good and true in the world for the hope of a utopia more terrifying than the most lurid descriptions of Hell. We must put down this Judeo-Spartakist experiment post-haste, every moment it is allowed to live is a crime against God."
RUS_most_unholy_beast:0 "The Most Unholy Beast"
RUS_most_unholy_beast_desc:0 "Perhaps we were too harsh on Germany. The communists in Berlin might have been rancid Jews but the Bolshevists in Paris seem to be demons sent directly from the ninth circle of Hell. It is the most rancid elements of every revolution of the past 150 years put together and made even worse. Even observing them makes one feel ill.\n\nBut it is sickeningly fitting that our crusade ends with them. They are the revolution made pure, the darkest elements of nihilism brought to the forefront. When we enter what they have falsely labeled "Le Soleil", we will burn it to the ground and salt the earth. For this whole rotten experiment in modernity began in Paris and it will end in Paris, once and for all."
