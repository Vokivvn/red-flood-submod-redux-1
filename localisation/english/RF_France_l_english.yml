#Brief history
FRANCE_FUTURIST_DESC:0 "After a bitter defeat in the Great War, France was thrown into chaos as state institutions of the Third Republic crumbled down. Street battles became commonplace, the masses demanded justice for the fallen, while the postwar youth rejected old traditions that almost brought their homeland to the grave. When the reactionary Action Française took power it was too late, as the economy collapsed following the shockwaves of the 1931 Crash. From this chaos, Antonin Artaud rallied the masses with his furious speeches and seized power. Now France is led by futurism, driven on by two needs - of Speed and Revenge."

#CHARACTERS#
FRA_antonin_artaud:0 "Antonin Artaud"

#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_ANTONIN_ARTAUD_DESC:0 "There are few people with such levels of passionate adoration as Antonin Artaud. Every element of France is geared towards securing his vision, and it all functions much like a theatre with several elements at play. In the great movement that France lives in, the dynamicism that it spins on, Artaud is the center, and everything goes and comes to him. Born from Smyrniote parents in Marseille, he had a difficult upbringing as an artist and continued to focus on development of his artistic spirit, eventually getting into politics as various right-wing movements and futurist-surrealist movements rise into importance by effect of the Fiume Endeavor and subsequent communist insurgency years later after the French Civil War, where France fell into conflict from Socialists against the Reactionary government, which is overthrown by the futurist militias across France. Raising Artaud as their leader after his mayorship in France increased immensely the numbers of the Escadron D'Futur, he subsequently began to do several measures to secure his power without upsetting the multiple factions within the futurist and surrealist paramilitaries, so he quickly proclaimed the FNAG, the Front National de Avant-Garde, which quickly got to work banning several parties according to the Futurist Charter as per written by Artaud himself. Now, France is a realm of dynamicism and energy, violent gangs across the State supressing any kind of anti-Artaud activity."
POLITICS_GEORGES_BATAILLE_DESC:0 "Georges Albert Maurice Victor Bataille has been called a "perverted degenerate", the "renegade surrealist", and the "dark side of the Artistic State", and now he sits at the top of the pile, leading the Artistic State to most ardently follow his beliefs regarding economics, social policy, and everything else. A deeply devoted anarch, he wishes to create a France devoid of government, law, and internationalism, and a drive towards excess, sexuality, and individualistic pleasure, along with mystical eroticism and aestheticism. Bataille's pious past in the Catholic Church made him deeply engaged with spiritualism and mysticism, harnessing a unique mindset for the future of France. The Renegade Surrealist has now risen from the backstreets of Le Soleil to the most respected aristocrat in the Artistic State."

france.1.t:0 "François de La Rocque and the Revolutionary Nationalists"
france.1.d:0 "After days of deliberation, the National Council has has transferred power over to François de La Rocque and his Revolutionary Nationalist Party of France."
france.1.a:0 "Vive la France Nouveau!"

france.2.t:0 "Formal Military Dictatorship"
france.2.d:0 "After several heated negotiation sessions, the French Military has formally taken control of the country. Admiral Francois Darlan has officially been named the Protector of France by the coalition government."
france.2.a:0 "May he bring stability to France"

france.5.t:0 "New Years Celebrations"
france.5.d:0 "To celebrate the New Year of 1936, Artaud, Le Patron of France, has organized an immense public party in Marseille. Beautifully ornate costumes and masks were encouraged, and lots of alcohol was made available. The party lasted until January 7th, with fireworks fired from artillery cannons across the city at every hour of every night. Huge bonfires roared ablaze fueled by the great stock of primitive Renaissance art. In particular, Artaud picked out The Annunciation, by Rogier van der Weyden, a 1400s painting, and ejaculated on it, before utterly destroying it with a powerful rifle and incendiary rounds, as crowds cheered loudly. The party had minimal coverage from the outside world, except for three American journalists with positive views towards France.\nThe party has caused major damage to the city, but everyone had a great time, and now volunteers are cleaning up the mess and the city continues to be as fiery and as fast as usual."
france.5.a:0 "Le Patron seemed to have fun"

france.6.t:0 "A Relaxing Dinner"
france.6.d:0 "Today, Patron Artaud was having a meeting with Georges Bataille - leader of the Acéphale - following Bataille's strange request to talk about "friendship" despite the strained tension between the newly estabilished cult around Artaud and the Acéphale secret society. Bataille offered Artaud some food and alcohol, and suddenly during the dinner, Artaud collapsed to the ground, unconscious. Georges Bataille quickly alerted Le Soleilians, and proclaimed himself the "Provisional Regent of France", in what some are calling a soft coup!"
france.6.a:0 "Seems like Artaud's public support got to his head"

france.7.t:0 "France at War Again"
france.7.d:0 "The delicate and fragile balance in Europe has finally been shattered as the Patron of France, Antonin Artaud, made a speech in Le Soleil declaring war on the United Kingdom.\n"Comrades, warrior-poets, riders of steel horses, priests of war, and lovers of art!"\nHe put down his cane and adjusted his scarf.\n"This crucial moment is our chance! We shall paint a great image over Britain! We will paint with our bombs, with our cars, and with their own blood. The plutocratic and reactionary regime of the United Kingdom has forced us to stand our ground and protect the oppressed masses of the world against the rotting corpse that is Anglo culture! The heart of this cancer, a bastion for the intellectually dull and meandering bourgeoisie is LONDON!"\nHe proclaimed, slamming his cane against the ground, and screaming energetically with dramatic, cathartic, and visceral gestures.\n"Our troops are ready to fight! The Acéphale have that their rituals and sacrifices are complete, so we can trust the Celtic gods in aiding our invasion!"\nArtaud then left the podium, walking over to a plane with speakers fitted on its sides.\n"The Anglo race has even failed to achieve the simplest of tasks - satisfying their women! We must help these poor souls out!"\nThe wise words of Le Patron echoed across our solar capital.\n"After our victory, we will put the Anglos in their rightful, historical place as a race of cuckolds! Our first aircrafts are on their way to London right now to drop lewd pictures of our troops, and love letters to future wives across The Channel."\nArtaud then flew away, throwing roses and firing his pistol into the air, to the clamor and praise of the residents of our great city."
france.7.a:0 "A conquest of land and women!"

france.8.t:0 "Strange, New Animals Gather"
france.8.d:0 "In the countryside, a new futurist faction within our movement - Clique Druidiste - is demonstrating their political influence by organising several Celtic pagan rituals in French forests. Most of their influence is in Brittany, but it's slowly spreading as the younger generations discover the sexual rituals involved. This new subculture is heavily influenced by Yugoslav Zenitism and French Primitivism, declaring that Celtic tribes lived fast lives despite their technological backwardness as true speed comes from the mind, not technology.\nMarc Augier, who is hailed as "Mestr", has already organised his followers into a paramilitary group dressed in nothing but the furs of wild animals. In the night, they claim that they become true animals."
france.8.a:0 "Let them have their gathering"
france.8.b:0 "Warn them about the dangers of separatism"

Today was not a normal training flight, instead of their usual instructor the squadron was led by a warrior-priest. He was dressed in a rough ox-skin jacket, which along with his helmet was painted in ornate and colourful patterns.\n\nAs they got into their planes and left the airfield, Anton's adrenaline was already rushing through his veins. They flew lower than normal for a good while until suddenly he could hear the warrior priest's voice through the radio, distorted by noise. \"Ok men, after me!\" the Priest said as Antonie could see his plane fly straight up into the sky, with the rest of the squadron following suit. It was then Antonie could feel it. As the G-forces was pushing on his body he could feel his Soul escaping his body, behind him the curtains of reality were unveiling, revealing the superworld. As his Soul was ascending he could feel the marrow in his bones being pushed down towards the ground. Whilst the Priest was chanting nonsensically through the radio Antonie felt his soul leaving him completely, the sensation knocking him unconscious. When he regained his senses he was in a black tunnel, at the end of it he saw the ground accelerating towards him, as he travelled through the tunnel closer to its opening he could feel himself regain power over his body.\n\nHe was shot out of the tunnel and back into reality, his plane speeding down towards the Earth. Antonie quickly, almost instinctively, pulled up his plane, again experiencing the orgasmic feeling of his soul leaving its mortal prison, almost losing consciousness again. It was only once Antonie re-joined the formation of planes that he truly regained his sense of reality, the low rumble that had covered his ears quickly turned to his friends' voices coming from the radio. \"Antonie!?

Already the Brits had started firing against them, their bullets whizzed past the formations below him, already speeding up, like rows of Napoleonic soldiers advancing on the British lines at waterloo. But he was above them. The planes below him were foot soldiers, he and his squadron were the Cavalry, the Escadron.\n\"Very well men, at my signal.\" Antonie said, carefully awaiting the moment, \"Now!\" he shouted, shooting his plane straight towards the British planes. As his plane and comrades accelerated towards the enemy, Antonie was no longer in his plane, in fact he was no longer on earth. He had been transported to space, like he had many times before, around him were stars and planets, at his side armies of angles were flying past him, on their way to annihilate anything in their path. But Antonie did not care for them, he was focused on controlling his empty body in his plane, like a remote-controlled robot. Antonie's squadron was charging the enemy from above, their heads filled with blood, their eyes were bloodshot and Antonie saw reality in a red hue. He pressed down on his triggers, his face was bright red and grimaced by the g-force. Bullets began spraying out the undersides of his wings, the expensive and carefully crafted planes of the British where torn to shreds like paper. Their pilots, middle aged, well trained and prepared where mangled and mutilated, like the body of a worm being pulled off the hook of an unsatisfied fishermen's rod, their bodies were thrown into the sea, along with the hole filled heaps of metal they once rode in.\n\nAs the battle ended and Antonie and his squad returned to flying as they had before, he could finally see the rim of England. Large peaceful plains rested on gigantic shelves of stone over the ocean's surface. The calm landscape helplessly looking on as the uncountable bombers behind rows of planes slowly made their way towards them, ready to annihilate all."

Then he began relaying his promises: to the children he promised the finest sweets and candies; to the adults he promised sex and hallucinogens.

After all, she did not harm any living creature, her sale of her fetus was based on voluntary exchange, and after the latest Decadence Decree, she couldn't have violated any obscenity laws for they no longer existed!

He opened the letter, his hands shaking.\n\n\"Dearest Friend,\nAs you have asked me to, I acted. I sent this package ahead of time, so you may receive it either before, or after, I have acted. I am sure you have heard of it on the radio, about Caen's poor mayor? No matter. I believe that this has solidified our friendship.\nWe have important matters to discuss once we meet, which I insist shall be soon. The fate of France is now bound with you, with me, and with every fellow Friend who recognizes Artuad's government for the falsehood it is. Whatever shape the reborn France may take, I know its birth shall be uneasy and bloody. I can supply men and material to you. Simply tell me what you need.\nSigned, A Friend of Old France.\nP.S. - Enjoy the tobacco.\""

Why one would insist on so many layers in the desert was beyond him. But that didn't matter, all it meant was that he drank from his wineglass from a straw. Definitely strange, but Maurice didn't feel criticizing a new friend for the oddities of his dress was worthwhile.\n\n\"Maurice, my friend,\" he said. \"I do not know what you envision for the state of France, but let me lay out my vision for the world.

Nothing, that's what! The coffee didn't need to taste good, though. He just felt...off today, like something else was nagging at his mind. Somewhere, in the back, inexpressible and constant.

It was the type of France he wanted to see, wanted to promote. They didn't even blink when he requested a straw with which to drink his espresso. Of course, people stared at him. They always did. But no one could see his face under the cloth. That was good. He needed to be hidden. Even if the cloth made him stand out, he could just go to Algeria, and lay low there.\n\nA black car drove up to the cafe, and he got inside.

Yes, exactly, a private moving nearby. In this room that had only one door, no corridors, and just he and Maurice. That...didn't make sense. But it was...the only explanation.

He nodded along, listening to whatever he had to say.\n\n\"Of course,\" Artaud said, pointing to a specific part on the map. \"We could try to strike here,\" he pointed at the mansion of someone he quite disliked.

It didn't matter. He sat, and watched the madman rave.\n\nThree militia-men were laughing with each other, talking about the man they were charged with executing. It was a mercy, really. Sometimes, people were just so far-gone that to call them people anymore was a form of torture. There were many madmen in France, people so blinded by some love of the past, some desire to preserve what never worked, and Artaud just...did not understand it. It was understandable, of course, that one would want to keep things the same. Status quos are comfortable. But they are also the bane of progress, something to be disregarded despite the discomfort. The unknown, the fear that you felt with something new, was no different than the pain in muscles one had after a good run. It was a sign of improvement. Those who denied that would rather watch their own collapse than embrace their future.\n\nAnd now, Artaud watched the militia raise their rifles.

One such incident occurred between supporters of Pierre Clementi and adherents of Marcel Bucard's economic policy. In a Parisian bar a heated discussion between the two groups turned first to name calling, the Clementi faction calling Bucard's supporters \"bourgois dogs\" and the \"vestiges of the old corrupt regime who should of been burned alongside it\" whilst the advocates for Bucccard named the Clementists as \"degenerate communists who should fuck off to Germany\", which then turned into a frightful scuffle. As the fight spilled out onto the streets, blood threatened to swarm the district as the combattants brandished knives, brass knuckles, clubs and razors. As heads were beaten, eyes were slashed and bodies mutilated it soon became apparent to all those who had heard the news of the clash that the Escadron was not as united as it appeared.

Dorgères had been an important figure during the overthrow of the republicans, as his Green Shirts were often the shock troops against republican revival in the countryside, most infamously during the suppression of a republican revolt in the Vendée region. However, he was dismayed by the popularity of the Escadron and Acephale factions, and started to help organize support for the Druidists out of spite.\nHenry Dorgères has put forward two demands; one, that the Green Shirts are recognized by the government as a legitimate organization, and that the Peasants' Defense Committees are merged with the government to ensure that the countryside is safe from any danger.

It began as a feudal remnant, some place for the Habsburgs to rest their wretched chins after returning from their niece's bedrooms. Next, the Huns run through it. As they're particularly and pathetically slow thinkers, flittering between servile monarchism and servile socialism, the Germans just left the non-state to rot! They set up a military government, forgot to install a puppet prince. A single worker and soldier's council tried to invade; they gave up in a bleak Wallonian field. The German occupation government there let itself diminish, half running off to Prussia, half devoting themselves to a new native military government. Isn't that ridiculous? You stay for so long in Wallonia, and you lose your purpose. You become a dinosaur, watching the economy decline, watching the world move on without you.\n\nLuckily, we can fix that! Jules Schmalzigaug is a futurist who understands how dreary the Wallonian construct is. Although he is both a native speaker of fake Flemish and he considers himself more inspired by the Italians, he has conjured up la Fraternité française futuriste, a brotherhood for all Wallonians who remember their Latinate heritage, and understand that France is the future of futurism.

Schmalzigaug found meaning during his time in Venice - he was a futurist even before our dearest Patron! - and during the French Insurgence, joining an escadron and warring against the French Faction of the Socialist International. Our Schmalzigaug lives in front of everyone else: despite being a Hun at heart, he sees more deeply than the average Frank. He's ahead of all trends; his enemy is stuck in the past. When he wins, we will surely accord him a place in the Chamber of Demiurges.\n\nOur opponent in every way is Herman Baltia. A wannabe generalissimo probably selected to rule Wallonia by the imperialist German Military Government for his German ancestry, Baltia has ruled by decree ever since. The very definition of a wretched old man, we hear that Baltia paints soggy watercolours whenever he's not demanding that any Frenchman who voices even slight opposition to his rule is beaten down.

If her choir was nice, orderly, innocent church boys and innocent church girls, you'd think she didn't care. Everyone's incoherency spilling onto the streets is a sign that something spectacular has occurred. The cacophony is really bliss.\n\nJules Schmalzigaug gave a speech in the Élysette, Baltia's former residence. Wallonia is now an integral part of France; it will never be separated again. Still, the work of the French people is never done. Now Wallonia and France are united, they must spread the light of futurism across Europe and then the globe.

However, our newfound friends have differing agendas and reasons for their support, and thus the final choice to decide who will play the first violin in new Germany belongs to us. \n\nFirst is Gerhard Roßbach, a leader of a freikorp in conflict with Luddendorff’s government, he has turned to us for support in waging his anti-communist crusade. His sympathies are authoritarian and militaristic. Fueled by hatred towards both capitalist decadence and communist anarchy, Roßbach wishes to administer Germany as a totalitarian, collectivist state ruled with an iron hand by paramilitary forces. While certainly less imaginative than our other contacts, what he lacks in vision he makes up for in efficiency and brutality; the appointment of Roßbach would create a state able to rule without scruples and crush all resistance to occupation. \n\nThe next is Hugo Hoeppener, better known by his artistic pseudonym, Fidus. A painter and mystic of national fame before the war, Fidus has involved himself with all kinds of utopian and revolutionary movements in his country. While initially supportive of the 1918 revolution, he has become disillusioned with the kind of order the Spartakists were creating in Germany and joined one of the conspiratorial so-called Green groups that opposed the communist regime.  Hoeppener’s sympathies lay close to those of monsieur Augier: his mysticism leads him to imagine a revival of the Aryan race in a vitalist spirit and a utopian synthesis of modernity and nature. His rule would provide a strong ideological foundation for the new Germany, that could heal the wound between our nations and provide a revolutionary alternative to the Spartakist sickness.\n\nThe last is Hans Richter, a star of the German avant-garde and a dissident Communist. One of the original members of the Dada group and the later Dadaist Party, his sympathies later turned to Constructivism and led him to become a leading figure of the oppositional Third International in Germany. The secret deal he proposes to us is the transformation of Germany into a highly autonomous experimental zone under the administration of the international avant-garde, harkening back to the original political program of the Dadaists. Such a government would preserve the advances made by the Spartakists and absorb much of the current administration, while breathing in a new truly revolutionary spirit to German socialism — making the country a ground for the most bold and brave modernist projects to unfold."

The current Walloon government is a freakshow, barely held together by an unholy union of anglophile hylics and lackeys of the former PRRRS government in France, neither of which seem to care about the wishes of the men they rule over.

The first wolf in the pack, Ismail Enver, has built his lair in Bukhara, having been driven out of Anatolia by the decadent Brits for the crime of trying to teach his subjects how to read and write. Such a decision was just one more injury to London's decaying foothold however, as it is unlike wolves to forgive a grave slight against themselves or their kin. Neither Russian petty sadism, nor British exploitation, nor liberal-spartakist cosmopolitan colonialism can contain his thirst for vengeance, and with Le Soleil's guns on his side none can withstand him. The second wolf rests closer to the source, within the heart of every brave Turkishman struggling to be freed from Western looters and their ulema servants. They rally behind the banner of the bloody crescent, ready to drive the foreigners back into the sea, as our glorious Jeanne once did, by Halide Edib, a shining scion of the late Mustafa Kemal.

After years of the noble Arabs playing fiddle to the redcoated band, London turns its attention away from the people they brought over to their side with honeyed words and false promises, opting to instead focus on playing Europe in a similar manner.

To take additional steps in ensuring that both the unsavory phallic shape currently assaulting the common sense of all romanians and the germanic stain of communism both vanish from Europe for good, it is important to provide all the support any well meaning Romanian needs to fend these devils off. However, the consensus between said Romanians happens to be split open in a way not too different from an amputee's leg… Nonetheless! Our time is rather limited to be holding tea parties, and trying to sway different camps to set aside their differences in hopes of standing tall against Berlin's aggression would make for a pointless, hair tearing, and dull errand. Instead, why don't we supply tons of guns to Muntenia and Moldova both?

Even now you can see their mouths watering, listen as they squeal in delight over the idea of waltzing from their little colonial tumour and onwards to loot Le Soleil, bear witness their endless kvetching over the FNAG violating their precious principles set by Earl Shaftesbury when he cast the curse of Whig history on the beautiful face of continental Europe. All this ends now. We shall take Calais by storm and march onwards all the way to London and let all the money hoarding plutocrats there know that their stiff upper lip is no match for our fist. Only with their skulls cracked open can Europe break free from the tyranny of international capital! "

Smell of corpses, smell of gasoline, smell of gunfire in the streets - London and Berlin, Madrid and Marseille, Belfast and Vienna too. None can escape the flood that engulfs their bodies and their minds in single sweep. Urban metropolis swept aside by the sound of artillery shells hitting the ground, picking off dozen soldiers in their way. Chaos shall reign for thousand years, and we futurist stand on watch for its cold embrace.\n\nThe crossed lighting shall stand eternally vigilant where the Siegessäule once stood, heroically commemorating our deepest dishonor transcended by our greatest triumph. It will fit perfectly well at the flagpole at Buckingham Palace, assuring the furious locals that we will never, ever, ever, ever leave them out of our sight - And unlucky for them, nothing is beyond our reach. Our brave boys in uniforms make way with the reactionary dogs women, ensuring a proper upbringing for Europe's next generation. The Solariade's first chapter comes to an end with everyone joyous, Europe liberated, and France triumphant. So let us all pave the road to a better future, one bullet or bomb at a time!\n\nGuerre à Outrance!"

FRA_hooray_fiume_desc:0 "If France is to be the Christ of the New Order, then that would make Fiume something of a more extravagant, sometimes grotesque, always jovial, John the Baptist. When d'Annunzio marched his first squadron of futurian warriors to reclaim their land from foreign hordes of slavic swineherders, they did not just cede the territory back to their equally small-minded-and-small-sized king, no. Instead, it became the foundation for something much greater: the declaration of the League of Fiume was only a small spark into the bonfire of the already chaotic early post war period, but a spark can nonetheless start a great fire - when you have enough gasoline to keep it ablaze. As it turns out, France has enough stockpile of all things flammable we can throw at our greatest allies. The only thing expected from the Arditi is to keep the bonfire burning, and soon Rome will catch ablaze."

FRA_meeting_high_king_desc:0 "There may be many friends of France in this world, but for now there is only one nation we can truly rely upon - Ireland. Padraig Pearse and the Sinn Fein movement have been loyal to Artaud and our country since the very beginning. It should be noted that unlike Fiume, they are encompassing the entire whole of a nation and are therefore the best prepared for any future conflict. They are not burdened by pesky land borders that surround them with the enemy-the point is that they are a free and great nation who deserves our utmost support. The scheming Anglos who brutalized and oppressed them for centuries lay next to them, and in return for any support in future conflicts, we certainly must help them out with destroying the pesky imperialists of London. Old France was defined by its wishy-washiness to its allies-no more of that nonsense."

Through our very foolish arrogance, we destroyed this bond and pushed our black brothers to the most drastic measures. We do not hold this against them... No, rather we should be the ones to reform ourselves! A black Frenchman is still a member of the French race! What makes our new Empire of the Future different from the stale Empires of the past is that we are a group of fraternal peoples. We do not intend to repeat the mistake of either Napoleon or the PRRRS. We are above both of them, we are more Bonapartist than Napoleon and more Radical than the Republicans! Therefore, learning from their mistakes, we do not intend to foment a new brother wars in the Francophone sphere, but rather we will work  towards a grand universal Empire of our breed!

FRA_cleansing_old_stain_desc:0 "One of the greatest blights of the old rotten world was the foundations of the despotic empires. Even today we are surrounded by them. The failure of the Russian Revolution maintained the reactionary beast of the Tsar and its old, dusty bore of a system. To our North lies the British Lion, whose dreams of empire may have been wounded following the Great War with the loss of the Jewel of Asia, but nevertheless remains a brutal force of autocracy over much of the world. And who could forget! The Germans to the East, who claim to oppose the machinations of the Imperialists, but see no hypocrisy in detente with the empire of Britain and still pursue domination over Europe, if not the world, as the Kaiser before them.\n\nIf we are to complete our revolution, it is necessary for us then to stand alongside the revolutionary spirit of national liberation against the backwards tyranny of Empire as was declared with the League of Fiume. But of course, there is an old problem. One of the last old stains of France, the last remnants of the reactionary Orleanists and Monarchists or of the liberal bores and their Republics. That is the problem of Algeria. For one hundred years, Algeria has rusted away and suffered under the cruel colonial policies of the French Empire. Even still there are some within the forces of revolution who declare themselves radical, but stumble and stir over the question in Africa. This is no way for the bringers of the new world to act! If we wish to end the rule of Empire, we must start at home. Giving full independence to Algeria so quickly and suddenly would be a sure fire way of disaster, especially with the Pied-Noir. Instead, let us reconcile the gap between the Mohammedans and the French Whites by granting them all citizenship within our new Republic. Not only will this new equality in society ensure that the ideals of the revolution spread into the province of Algeria, but to be certain we will have much to learn from the natives of this ancient land as well. With an endeavour that promises to benefit all parties involved, we may look on with hope to the glistening gem that is the future, hand in hand and united with our brothers in the South! "

It remains vulnerable to the machinations of the Red menace over their borders, who dream of a red flag flying over Vienna. A new political order has come into power there, and we are yet unsure of how aligned they are with our goals. That Austria has long been an enemy of France, or that the current Austria ruler is a little different from who we're used to dealing with - it does not change the fundamentals. We must establish strong and friendly relations with them, to create an anti-communist bulwark helmed by a man (pliable or otherwise) we can trust to keep the reds out of government. That above all is the number one priority, for when the time comes, Germany will inevitably interfere in Austria sooner or later."

FRA_backroom_talks_poland_desc:0 "Our friends in Poland seem to have gotten all intimate with the Spartakist robber barons. This is, of course, very regretable, especially considering all that France has historically done for them since Napoleon, but far from the end of the world. The Polish intelligentsia has always been reluctant to seal that obnoxious wedding ceremony by kissing King Kautsky on his tottering lips, choosing instead to settle for more and more meager compromises were more stable economic and military alliances could form. Thank God for that, otherwise all this militarization might have turned out more trouble than what it's worth. With such an open window of Polish sensibilities playing against kraut stubbornness, making them compliant shall be walk in the park. We hold little to no interest in the reactionary backwater east of the Oder that insultingly calls itself an Empire, while Polish survival depends on its total and utter obliteration. A rather simple and direct deal can be struck taking this into account: We will let the poles get their grubby paws on everything beyond the Polish-German border, and they will leave us to our devices while we rain havoc upon the streets of Frankfurt. And to sweeten the deal, we'll allow them to draw the border of Poland on the Oder itself – it's not like we were going to use it."

This pathetic "army" and their tremendously pompous Swedish and Russian compatriots are far from suitable for us. Verdun still dances like it was yesterday in the minds of the Escadron, and they will settle for nothing less than watching Berlin engulfed by flames in retaliation. Many sympathetic Germans rush towards us with open arms, so why not accommodate them instead?

Old France was one such victim, and the experience has left it scarred and bruised for centuries. This weak, feeble France has long since died however, and we who rise from her ashes know what has always belonged to us. Forget Alsace and Lorraine, let us undo everything the insolent krauts have ever stolen from us!
