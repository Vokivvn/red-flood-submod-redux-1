#LEADER DESCRITIONS#

#IDEAS#
MAD_british_direct_rule:0 "British Direct Rule"
MAD_british_direct_rule_desc:0 "As the Raj fell around it, the Madras Presidency was swiftly identified as a holdout and taken under close watch from London. The military effort was directed by the telephone, leaving the Presidency's administration effectively under direct control from Britain. This system of tight watch has remained in place since, in order to maintain the Presidency until the government back home can come up with a plan to fully withdraw or prepare to fight our way back in India."
MAD_collapsing_raj:0 "Collapsing Raj"
MAD_collapsing_raj_desc:0 "The territory of the former Raj is still aflame, tensions are still high and fighting continues sporadically. The country's swift disintegration has wrought havoc on trade, industry, travel and all the facets of governance."
MAD_partisan_infestation:0 "Clashing Partisans"
MAD_partisan_infestation_desc:0 "The Theosophical Society and various Dravidian Nationalists, Socialists and loyalists of Subhas Bose are clashing frequently in the countryside. The Theosphical Society does not officially pose much of a threat, its headquarters near Madras is more of a school than a political recruitment centre. Nonetheless their influence is felt, and they are attracting trouble."
MAD_refugee_crisis:0 "Refugee Crisis"
MAD_refugee_crisis_desc:0 "The Fall of the Raj has driven thousands into our already shaky hands. Brits and Indian Rajas, Christians and Brahmins fleeing persecution. The weight of the influx is straining our resources."

#CUSTOM TOOLTIPS AND FLAGS#

MAD_SETTING_SUN_DESC:0 "Following the fall of the British Raj in 1934, the Madras Presidency is the only state on mainland India that has both remained under colonial authority and still has direct ties with the British Empire. While weakened from the revolts it has started to recover and acts as the British last hold onto the mainland. However its fate is directly tied with what Britain does with it, can the Madras Presidency survive or will it fall like the rest of the Raj?"
