#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_BERNARD_BOURDILLON_DESC:0 "Born in Tasmania, Sir Bernard Henry Bourdillon has always been at the fringes of the British Empire. Governing Ceylon, a remnant of British India until 1932, he was then transferred to Uganda, and remained in Africa for the next couple of years - seeing the collapse of authority in nearby colonies such as Niger, he became more stringent in policy, despite having immense sympathies for the natives. Considering everything, Bourdillon is a good colonial manager, one of the best, even. Maintaining good order and keeping the natives happy is not easy, but Bernard is ready for the job."
#IDEAS#
NGA_split_nation:0 "Split Nation"
NGA_split_nation_desc:0 "Nigeria is a deeply divided, artificial colony of a nation. With regional monarchs numbering in the dozens, Islam in the north, indigenous beliefs and Christianity sharing the south, among hundreds of problems, it appears that Nigeria will forever remain divided in religion, culture, politics, and everything you can think of."
