#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
#IDEAS#
SYR_syrian_circlejerk_war:0 "The Bells of Jerusalem"
SYR_syrian_circlejerk_war_desc:0 "When Damascus was liberated from Ottoman rule, it was not Allenby or the men in London who shattered the chains, but the proud armies of the Hashemite Arab forces. Thus when time came to carve up the dying empire, who else would be better fit to rule the lands of Syria than those who conquered it? Yet some things are simply too good to be true, and through decades of mismanagement and the death of King Faisal, in 1935 the bonds so-long established beneath the rule of the Viziers had rotted through. Brother took up arms against brother, and as Ghazi was crowned King of Sand, his domain turned to dust beneath his very feet. Now, amidst the disintegration of the United Kingdom of Greater Syria into a multitude of ethnic realms, imams from Jerusalem to Aleppo lead the faithful in a prayer for peace and end to war."
