#FOCUSES#
#Political#
HAR_walking_in_the_ashes:0 "Walking in the Ashes"
HAR_walking_in_the_ashes_desc:0 "The Russian Republic is dead. With politics too riven by factionalism to respond to the crisis, the military launched a coup, only to destroy itself with its own varied loyalties. With ethnic separatism, warlordism, and rumors of imperial sympathizers springing into action in the north, what remains of the Harbin political establishment is due for a rude awakening. Before all is lost, we must reach out to those left alive and see if the situation can be salvaged."
HAR_most_unlikely_alliance:0 "The Most Unlikely Alliance"
HAR_most_unlikely_alliance_desc:0 "What would be unthinkable under any other circumstances appears to be becoming reality in the void of Zheltorossiya. Aleksei Gastev is the most prominent leftist leader remaining in the cursed city, and he has unparalleled pull with the unions we are relying on to arm the state. Alisa Rosenbaum, the arch-Nietzschean, is the heir apparent of the decapitated Kadets and has no intention of letting the republic die, not now. It will take a heroic effort to save the regime in Harbin, and the two factions must act quickly, decisively, to work out a compromise government and allocation of responsibilities."
HAR_anarchy_mother_of_order:0 "Anarchy, the Mother of Order"
HAR_anarchy_mother_of_order_desc:0 "Controlling the capital was one thing, but our system's grasp must be expanded beyond it. But rather than restoring some facsimile of the dead republic or any other bureaucratic state to shackle our hinterland to Harbin, we will birth a new order with a new foundation. Failure has cleared the ground and presented us with an opportunity to forge something more - something dynamic, organic."
HAR_no_limits_to_creativity:0 "No Limits to Creativity"
HAR_no_limits_to_creativity_desc:0 "The grandiose bureaucracies of reactionaries and authoritarian socialists are like cans in which the beauty of the individual suffocates, limited to the philistine demands of the State. We will never accept anything! In the future we are building, there will be no limits to individual genius, the brightest stars will be given full freedom to create whatever they want. Soon, Russia will become the land of the greatest artists, scientists, engineers and poets – each of them like a free angelic soul sliding their own route in the heavens on wings that no one will dare to cut."
HAR_everyone_but_parasites:0 "For Everyone but Parasites"
HAR_everyone_but_parasites_desc:0 "We, the living, have fed them all a thousand years. Society breaks down into those who produce wealth, and those who merely exploit it - the republic supposedly arrayed against the entrenched mediocrity of the empire was still all-too-willing to protect a new class of parasite. Now the veneer of civility that protected them is gone, and all their control over the levers of power has gone with it. From now on, power and rights are accorded by one's true worth. A true meritocracy will blossom from our state and reinvigorate all classes in action."
HAR_perfection_without_center:0 "Perfection Without a Center"
HAR_perfection_without_center_desc:0 "The science of tektology, to this time associated with authoritarian centraother offers a breath of new possibilities! Knowing the right relations we will shape our society to resemble a slime mold or a spider's web – a self-emergent system of interactions between autonomous actors that nonetheless creates a greater whole. Now a backwater wasteland, Russia will become a perfect, ever-expanding web of gleaming lights and towering cities, connected by the veins of railroads, carrying the blood of locomotives!"
HAR_union_man:0 "The Union Man"
HAR_union_man_desc:0 "If only it had been under better circumstances. Aleksei Gastev assumes power in the revolutionary Directorate, but the death throes of Zheltorossiya have required a drastic reassessment of priorities. Gone are the dreams of a perfected bureaucratic state, gutted by infighting before they could bloom. The Bogdanovite is excised from the machine. Wires long dormant reignite, and what reactivates is better suited for the chaos of free Russia."
HAR_beauty_of_class_struggle:0 "Beauty of Class Struggle"
HAR_beauty_of_class_struggle_desc:0 "The suffocating mediocrity of the reactionary, the bourgeois, the parliamentarian, all pales before the peal of revolutionary thunder. A proletariat beaten into constraining their dreams must learn to fly again. Every shell chambered, every tool cast, is a part of the emancipatory struggle. Let them know the truth of our transformative war. The worker-soldier who is cognizant of their historical task will do their job to the utmost, and the mass general strike will be waged at home and on the front."
HAR_creative_market:0 "A Creative Market"
HAR_creative_market_desc:0 "The managers are gone. The stores of accumulated wealth and influence that allowed the aristocrats to distort the economy are in ruins. On a leveled playing field, we have an opportunity to truly unleash the creative potential of the working class. The unions and worker-owned associations now compete on their own merits, and those who best understand their field make the organizational decisions. As a bonus, the spark of dynamism can be harnessed for our military construction and research."
HAR_ceaseless_speed_of_industry:0 "The Ceaseless Speed of Industry"
HAR_ceaseless_speed_of_industry_desc:0 "Onward, onward. Bending, breaking, reshaping. Heroic hands wield machines in the rejuvenation of the country. To fall now would condemn the Republic and Russia itself to eternal stagnation. Everything must be reworked. The forced decentralization we have undergone allows for rapid innovation by the gripping hand. Autonomy and education of the workers leads them to surprise us with their ingenuity. Industrial Arditism. Dynamism extends to the logistical train and the mobile strike force. Forceful thrusting industry with an army to match."
HAR_siberian_fantasy:0 "A Siberian Fantasy"
HAR_siberian_fantasy_desc:0 "The wastes of Siberia and the Far East are to us a space of boundless possibilities. What is now the quiet tundra and taiga is a chest of neverending treasures. From the raw ore of this land we will cast the capital of the world! In the future – the widest country will turn to a bright lantern of the world, covered in cities and railroads. Its riches will eclipse Moscow and Petersburg, the new power will put Europe and America to shame! Let it be known to every labourer and every businessman – their work is refining a new diamond in the world's crown!"
HAR_revolution_everywhere:0 "The Revolution Everywhere"
HAR_revolution_everywhere_desc:0 "The Directorate has successfully articulated a new revolutionary programme. A new order is born from the death of the Republic. Now, a greater test of our resolve lies. Struggle has forged other regimes out of the fragments of Zheltorossiya, and we must prove our system can out-compete them.\n\nThe revolutionary war against the damnable Russian Empire begins here in the east, and no ethnic partisan nor traitor can stop us."
HAR_push_north:0 "Push to the North"
HAR_push_north_desc:0 "An ocean of blood spilled to return us to our starting position, yet the revolutionary war economy only grows stronger. With flash and dynamism, we must make up for lost time! Toppling the Empire demands we seize the territory and resources east of the Urals before they can be marshalled against us, and then bend the barrels of their guns back to aim at the oppressors. We must pull Siberia and the far east into our system, decisively and in totality."
HAR_liberate_homeland:0 "Liberate the Homeland"
HAR_liberate_homeland_desc:0 "Before the Directorate stands the ultimate test of our system against the reactionaries of Russia. The fires of the Republic's demise have purified our freedom of its corruption and forged a terrible weapon in our hands. So begins the final struggle for the soul of the people, between servitude and a liberty as great and terrifying as the dawn. No more halfway war. No more cowardly pity. Death to all who stand in the way of the revolution!"
HAR_business_woman:0 "The Business Woman"
HAR_business_woman_desc:0 "The Republic failed. Again. It seemed the only options were flight or death at the hands of the Black Hundreds. Again. And we are in freefall. Again. \n\nOr so one would think. Perhaps Zheltorossiya's dying agony had burned out the mewling weakness and wreckers from Harbin, in one last act of creative destruction. A new Zheltorossiya could emerge, hungry and untamed. But more than anything, free."
HAR_against_crony_capitalism:0 "Adopting the Boston School"
HAR_against_crony_capitalism_desc:0 "An ocean and a dear republic away, many approaches to maximal liberty have been theorized. What we need now is the thought of de Cleryre and Spooner, the right kind of anarchists for a truly free Russia. Employment, markets, these are not anathema to a liberated country. But the ground must be swept clean. What luck that the most entrenched parasites in our backyard have turned tail and fled to Primorye! With a new line adopted by the Directorate, every Russian in the lands we claim will be free to live and prosper on their own merits."
HAR_let_markets_eat_rich:0 "Let the Free Market Eat the Rich"
HAR_let_markets_eat_rich_desc:0 "Among the Directorate and our base, there is much resistance to overcome in delivering a truly free market alongside a free society. They fear our rhetoric is nothing but a veil to place over another round of exploitation, and the corporate aristocracy in new clothing getting their hands around the neck of the government. \n\nThey will see that our liberation spares no one. The idle and incompetent will be thrown into the teeth of the free market. With a swift blow we will end their entrenched privilege, the shoring up of their monopolies. To the victors go the spoils."
HAR_anarchy_action:0 "Anarchy, Action!"
HAR_anarchy_action_desc:0 "I, we, did it. The state is dead, and we killed it! Now free, thinking man is no longer needlessly held back by the chorus of moochers and jailers. Reaching toward the future, he seizes his potential for himself. Now "Why should I" quails before "Why not" - the question is not who will let you, but who will stop you. A new Arditi of spirit is born."
HAR_society_of_heroes:0 "A Society of Heroes"
HAR_society_of_heroes_desc:0 "For too long, we have prized values that are diametrically opposed to a truly free society. Capable individuals were constrained by responsibilities and limitations placed upon them for the good of others, as though these beneficiaries could not defend themselves. Now the new order prizes heroism, and the works that self-interest and the skills to fulfill those interests can produce. When rational man's results are directly connected to their efforts, and they know the order of the day will not interfere with this, they will go above and beyond expectations."

HAR_alisa_rosenbaum_desc:0 "The Republic is dead. The Kadet leadership has gone with it. The story of Alisa Rosenbaum, head of the young wing of the party and libertarian firebrand, has taken a different turn altogether.\n\nRosenbaum, even before she became a member of the Soviet, spent her adulthood keenly aware of the threat on the Republic's borders. Her reasonably comfortable adolescence was upended practically in an instant at the outbreak of the Civil War, when the Black Hundreds saw their chance to pull the motherland back onto its old course. As a family of Russian Jews, her father's pharmacy became an incidental target of Black Hundreds violence, and they fled with the republicans to the Far East. Those hungry, violent years were a massive influence on Rosenbaum, who grew into a controversial and confrontational figure in the Kadets on the basis of her antagonism to the imperial autocracy, but also all other forms of authoritarianism.\n\nShe greeted the fall of Kerensky with champagne, the rise of the socialists with furious denunciations, and everything that followed with a numb sense of shock. How had the Zheltorossiyan political elite botched things so badly? Why weren't the Kadets doing something to stop this? Did anybody understand that there was nowhere left to retreat to if the Republic fell? Bitterly disappointed by the secession of the Primorye bourgeoisie, Rosenbaum found herself suddenly side by side with other Russians who had no other options.\n\nWhat came to unite her Kadet remnant with the "Vperedists mugged by reality" was a simple maxim - is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? If you believe that, then no statist, no warlord, no obstacle to human freedom is worth bending the knee to. Business can wait - right now, Harbin needs heroes."
HAR_Aleksei_gastev_desc:0 "The Republic is dead. The RSDRP leadership has gone with it. The story of Aleksei Gastev, head of the Central Institute of Labour and arch-technocrat of the Vperedists, has taken a different turn altogether.\n\nPrior to the Great War, Gastev's years of exile and factory work within and without Russia were an inspiration to his future beliefs. While greatly interested in Fordist labour organization, his time spent in French automobile factories also introduced him to the intellectual currents of French syndicalism. In the context of a country with a larger industrial proletariat than the Russian Empire, he reasoned, the trade union could be a tool of workers' advancement even without a vanguard party to lead them. Capitalism could be confronted on the factory floor by the people organizing themselves for their goals. Still, pulled into Bogdanov's orbit and other exile Bolshevik circles, Gastev's mind turned to the task of how best to manage production under socialism, and for a time the possibilities seemed limitless.\n\nWhen the infighting of the Soviet's leftist coalition proved fatal, Gastev began to wonder if his contributions to the RSDRP had been a deviation from the proper course toward socialism. For one, the easy defeat of the party leadership and the chaos unfolding in the capital proved the dangers of over-centralization. Meanwhile, the factional disputes that led to Bogdanov's fall demonstrated the dangers of the vanguard party model. Adrift in Harbin, he came into contact with another political orphan, and a pact that would have been unthinkable a year ago was struck. The principle that a worker is entitled to the sweat of his brow forged the revolutionary Directorate, primarily along his old syndicalist lines. Industry, machinery, all of those are aspirational, but right now, this dead republic needs heroes.\n\nWorkers."

##Collapse Events
##Manchu Leaves
HAR.11.t:0 "The Rōnin Goes Rogue!"
HAR.11.desc:0 "In the furthest corners of our Republic, trouble was always afoot no matter where you went. Riddled with poverty and crime, the law was primarily upheld by graciously empowered local mayors, their conditions could only be politely described as 'hellish', even before the collapse of authority from Harbin.\n\nNow that those shockwaves have reached the distant provinces, the reports are far from pretty. Warbands of Chinese bandits, traditionally held back by the officers of our military, have overwhelmed the severely understaffed and cut off garrison stationed there. With General Boldyrev's forces driven further east, the region had functionally become a bandit kingdom in its own right. The king they chose to crown was none other than Date Junnosuke, a self styled ronin and charismatic scion of the Junnosuke samurai clan. Many however speculate that the Ronin's authority is only a spectacle for the masses, one held up by the very real force of a modern kingmaker — his close friend and exiled Beiyang general, Zhang Zongchang."
HAR.11.A:0 "The Jurchen dragon roars again!"
HAR.11.B:0 "This can only get worse…"

##Priamurye Leaves
HAR.12.t:0 "An Island in the Sun"
HAR.12.desc:0 "When one crosses the sandy and wide river banks of the rivers Amur and Ussuri eastward, one would scarcely believe that the country is in any state of distress or chaos. Militias diligently patrol the borders and farmlands under orders of the so-called and recently proclaimed Republic of Priamurye, ensuring the safety and diligent obedience of its citizens. Trucks, cars, trains, and even the occasional wagon pulled by horses crosses the many roads that lead to the Jewel of the Pacific: the great city of Vladivostok.\n\nFrom Vladivostok, which still receives as many if not more merchant vessels as before the collapse of the central government, the brothers Spyridon and Nikolai Merkulov have procured a free state that has managed to keep the flow of wealth and goods almost intact. With the support of many moderate politicians and industrialists, as well as a flow of Russian immigrants escaping the racewar in the countryside, Priamurye is slowly but surely transforming into a small haven of prosperity in the midst of war. \n\nHowever, this peace that comes at a price: democratic institutions are suspended with no sign of ever returning, and the Republic's efforts to boost wealth has given untold amounts of power to the fabulously wealthy while many citizens work themselves to death to pay for loans taken from these oligarchs. Calls to take assertive action and launch a campaign to reclaim the whole peninsula begin to be more and more popular among these industrialists, and even some whisper about a future attempt to, in their own words, \"reclaim the homeland\"."
HAR.12.A:0 "The last bastion of safety and stability in Yellow Russia, hurrah for the Merkulovs!"
HAR.12.B:0 "A statelet for and by oligarchs, who'd want to fight alongside them?" 

##Green Ukraine Leaves
HAR.13.t:0 "Ukranians Never Die!"
HAR.13.desc:0 "The Russian Republic's complete inability to handle the complaints and needs of the Ukranian minority within its borders have proved to be fatal.\n\nSent over to this piece of Asia to settle the land in the name of the Tzar, more recent migratory waves made the "Green" Ukraine, as it became known, one of the pillars of local government. Lack of proper representation in the Republic's institutions after the civil war quickly turned the colonists against the Russian-dominated central government. The formation of agrarian self-defense leagues against percieved tyrannical overreach, coupled with the import of ultranationalist ideas from mainland Ukraine, made it so the situation quickly got out of hand. There began to be OUN-influenced terrorist groups, such as the one that killed Trotsky and Chapayev themselves, enacting racial vengeance on Muscovites for their crimes against the Ukranian nation and people.\n\nNow that all the separatist parties and organisations have unilaterally declared independence, there remains to be seen how this Republic of the Green Ukraine will operate. Although a majority of the farmers and settlers are content with simple representation and an effective, compassionate democracy, it wouldn't be a surprise if the wild nationalist fervor of these extremist groups took hold of their small world and launched them into a vengeful nation-building project in the midsts of Manchuria."
HAR.13.A:0 "In the name of the Green Ukraine, our home away from home!"
HAR.13.B:0 "Terrorists and peasants, as expected from Ukranians."

##Free Creatorium Leaves
HAR.14.t:0 "Spark on the Amur"
HAR.14.desc:0 "The Vperedists have always been a known element within the Socialists of our republic, but it seems with the extension of pressures, the internal politics has taken a turn for the truly bizarre. An uprising calling itself the Free Creatorium, led by an irregular gang of scientists, mystics and revolutionaries, have pledged to reshape not just Zheltorossiya and the entire country but the entirety of the Earth into a truly unified organism.\n\nThough served by a mere couple of thousand men fighting under them, but these are highly loyal to the cause, well-trained, and forceful purveyors of both violence and their ideology. Additionally, they are in the process of absorbing the old factions of the Zheltorossiyan left, whether by force or by persuasion. Composed of two factions within this Creatorium, each competing for their claim on the divine: one, led by a Alexander Yaroslavsky, mixes the ideology of Cosmism with an anarchist call of total liberation of body and spirit, and the overthrow of the tyrannical laws of nature, while the other, led by a Valerian Murayev, is bent on turning the world into a completely coordinated society, a grand concerto intent on dragging humanity into the blinding light of the dawn."
HAR.14.A:0 "To the reshaping of the Earth and the liquidization of barbaric democracy!"
HAR.14.B:0 "What have they unleashed?"

##Boldyrev Leaves
HAR.15.t:0 "Boldyrev Rides Forth"
HAR.15.desc:0 "When the chaos began, general Vasily Boldyrev and his patchwork brigade of men were tasked with a single mission: to maintain order in his assigned tract of Zheltorossiyan soil. Now that there is no higher authority to answer, beyond his rifle, however, Boldyrev had decided to see exactly how far he can take his assigned mission, all in the service of the people of Russia.\n\nA dedicated Menshevik, and a veteran of both war and revolutionary struggle, he is no stranger to the use of violence in the service of a better world. The bureaucrats and party cadres in Harbin have gone astray, and left the once proud Zheltorossiyan Republic in dire straits. But the dream is only dead if it is allowed to die — something that the old general has made clear he will not allow happen while he yet draws breath."
HAR.15.A:0 "For Russia's freedom, I shed blood!"
HAR.15.B:0 "Delusions of grandeur, and nothing more."

##Rodzaevsky Leaves
HAR.16.t:0 "A Clermont in the Far East"
HAR.16.desc:0 "The total failure of the left-wing mission in the hands of Harbin, bringing it from relative prosperity to the deepest abyss in mere months, has the almost inevitable consequence of a loss of faith in the gospel of Republicanism — and the return to the faith of the old Gospel, the gospel of Christ Jesus. An army of radicalised peasantry, members of the church, and officers from across the border with Yakutia now march for the salvation of Russia. Spearheaded by Konstantin Rodzaevsky - once dismissed as a rabble rouser and terrorist, now risen from the mire as a bonafide warlord. His mission: to free Manchuria, once the crowning jewel of the Russian Empire, from all those who have led Russia astray — the Communists, the Freemasons, and the Jews.\n\nFlocking to his banner in the hundreds, the magnetism of the Vozhd in the north has flared up the hearts and minds of the poor and the downtrodden, nestled in the shadows and crevices where Harbin's divine light never graced. Can this righteous rabble, armed with scrounged rifles and battered prayer books, triumph against all the doubters and sinners?"
HAR.16.A:0 "God with us!"
HAR.16.B:0 "Their naïve Crusade will end shipwrecked."

#The choice
HAR.30.t:0 "The Directorate Meets"
HAR.30.desc:0 "The chaos brought upon by the general collapse of the Zheltorossiyan government requires new methods - gone are the days of corrupt politicking and lazy parliamentarism. The new governing body, whatever may it be, requires energy and decisive action.\n\nWith these principles in mind, the first meeting of the Emergency Directorate of the Russian Republic was conducted. Most of the big political players were either dead or missing, thus only a few could participate in this elite council of visionaries. Something had to be done to bridge the immense ideological gap between the participants. Indeed, the brightest stars of the Directorate came from the opposite ends of the Zheltorossiyan political spectrum. Alisa Rosenbaum, the leader of the Young Kadets, the prophet of individualism and Aleksei Gastev, a Bolshevik union man and a famous proponent of the most radical collectivism conceivable.\n\nYet, in these two very different souls - there flickered a common spark, a certain love of power and energy, the desire to wage a Promethean war against the world. Wasn't Gastev in his youth a syndicalist anarchist and an avid reader of Sorel? He didn't change all that much since then, the chaos around him made him realize - only the heroic might of struggle can save civilization. And on the other hand, Rosenbaum, it would be unjust to call her merely a disciple of capitalism. Capitalism - it is but a tool, a tool that allows the extraordinary individual to strive, maybe in the end, anarchism of the old school - without collectivist perversions, can also achieve that?\n\nThus, in the most miraculous alliance of the century, Alisa Rosenbaum and Aleksei Gastev have decided to work together - for a free and powerful Russia, where human beings will live free of old traditions and irrational social norms. Yet, one question remains - to be decided by a vote by the Directorate. Who will become the new institution's chairman? The hands are raised, history is made, and then, an exclamation:"
HAR.30.a:0 "Gastev will be our savior!"
HAR.30.b:0 "Rosenbaum knows the way!"
