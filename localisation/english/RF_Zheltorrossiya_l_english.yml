#Leader descriptions
POLITICS_BOGDANOV_DESC:0 "Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Bogdanov can be called one of the last true polymaths - a scientist, heralded for his innovations in the fields of systems theory and medicine, a succesful writer of science fiction, a capable organiser, a philosopher - and now, the visionary leader of the new revolutionary Republic of Zheltorossiya. A true intellectual mind behind the steers of this shabby boat, meant to moor in the harbor bright future for all - in the stars and even beyond.\n\nBeing among the founders of the radical Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, Bogdanov fell into conflict with the now disgraced Vladimir Lenin. Accusing the old leader of ceasarist and authoritarian tendencies, Bogdanov's avant-garde faction of the party took initiative during the 1905 revolution, slowly transforming the glorified terrorist organisation into a carefully designed machine, creating, on the principle of rational technocracy, a platform for the Russian proletariat, relentlessly laboring to throw off the old shackles and create a new, industrial and collective culture.\n\nYet Bogdanov doesn't see the future of humanity as mere cogs, crushed under the weight of a great machine. From the revolution, a New Man will arise - free and powerful, taking from the fullness of life, a real God of this world. And this revived humanity will partake in a glorious conquest of all nature to serve its will, breaking the chains of hunger, want, gravity and even death.\n\nWill this crazy alchemy succeed, a new race of immortal gods walking the Earth? Or will the Bolsheviks' dream be buried under the imperial bayonets, leaving mere rubbles of the new Babel this modern Nimrod called to pierce the skies?"
POLITICS_CHAPAYEV_DESC:0 "A radical Anarchist general in Kerensky's army, Chapayev saw an opportunity in the political turmoil surrounding the collapse of all authority in Zheltorossiya. The people were suffering, and they cried out in anger at a government which had failed to deliver on its promises. The people demanded justice, and as Chapayev listened to their cries, he resolved to give it to them. But he realized something else, too. No one can truly be trusted with the people's freedom. No one, that is, except the people themselves. Chapayev's military experience has thus far equipped him to protect his chaotic realm, but only time can tell how long the fragile peace will last."
POLITICS_SPIRIDONOVA_DESC:0 "In a stunning turn of fate, Maria Spiridonova has managed to take power, achieving what Nechayev could not and bringing the true light of Narodnaya Volya to Russia. Distrusting of both Bolshevist elitism-authoritarianism and Menshevik red tinted liberal democracy, Spiridonova aims to achieve the dream for which so much blood was shed: A new Russian nation, where every voice stands heard, no matter its significance. Can Spiridonova bring down the Tzars autocracy, or will the Dream of Nechayev forever remain a dream?"

#Ideas
ZHR_besieged_republic:0 "Siege Mentality"
ZHR_besieged_republic_desc:0 "Peaceful sleep is a rare gift in Zheltorossiya. The hungry double-headed eagle in the West tears itself apart for now, but how long can it take until Kolchak will gather his armies and order them to crush the last bastion of liberty in Russia? This worry is omnipresent in the politics of Zheltorossiya, giving way to various radicals, promising a revolutionary revival and the destruction of the Empire once and for all. For these fears, the democratic government had to loosen their principles and institute an army service for all citizens, along with arms stockpiled in every town. When they will come they'll meet our every man and woman armed to the teeth, ready to strike back at their oppressors."

ZHR_safe_haven:0 "The One Haven of Freedom"
ZHR_safe_haven_desc:0 "In the West, the ruthless eye of the Okhranka watches you, especially if you read dangerous books that may give you dangerous ideas. The purification policies, that lay waste in the Imperial academia, became a strength for the Republic. Dissidents flood the gates of Zheltorossiyan univiersities, Harbin becoming the new centre of Russian learning and culture. A new life breathes into the Republic, that one day might unite all Motherland under the flag of freedom."

ZHR_railway_crash:0 "The Railway Crash"
ZHR_railway_crash_desc:0 "The dependence of the Zheltorossiyan economy on Japan paid its due, in a way more catastrophic than anyone could expect. Civil war raging in the Land of the Rising Sun, the mighty Zaibatsu fell down like cardboard towers. The consequences for Zheltorossiya, for the worse, experiencing an ill harvest this year, were disasterous - the supply lines became paralysed overnight, thousands lost their jobs, trade became impossible, factories stopped working. The prices of basic utilities rose to the skies, the people, demanding bread came to the streets, a wave of protests submerging the state. General strike was declared, pressing radical leftist demands against the government (with no doubt, a merit of the ambitious and inteligent organiser - Aleksei Gastev).\n\nYet in this chaos, the more far-sighted individuals, some would say cynical, see an opportunity. The fist of Japanese influence being broken, the reign of the corrupt government may come to an end, opening a new, brighter chapter in Zheltorossiyan history."

ZHR_state_of_revolution:0 "State of Revolution"
ZHR_state_of_revolution_desc:0 "With the political victory of the revolutionary faction of the RDSRP, allied with the OLN, Zheltorossiya was turned on its head overnight. With the blessing of the new government, the Red Guards, under the command of Leon Trotsky and Aleksei Gastev stormed the parliament, declaring a hastily written manifesto announcing the liquidation of the bourgeiosie Supreme Soviet and submission of all the power into the hands of the People's Revolutionary Comittee, its most prominent members being Aleksandr Bogdanov, Maria Spidironova and Gastev himself. The Comittee has to reign absolute power until \"stability is restored and new state of affairs based on the principle of socialist democracy is estabilished\". This unstable rule meets resistance from the nation's nascent capitalists, some worrying a total dissolution of the Republic is to come - or worse, that the \"people's fist against reaction\" will turn into an apparatus of new totalitarian tyranny."

Even with its disfucntional system that has allowed the rise of all kinds of extremists, Zheltorossiya is still a beacon of democracy in East Asia, but for how much longer?"

All his intellect is lost in a bottle, all his militancy is spent on his wife and children.\n\nIt is time to eradicate this false enjoyment. The intoxication of Vodka will be replaced with the intoxication of culture and labor; the hangovers from vice will be supplanted by an enrichment of spirit - true spirit.

And as it happens, the greatest pool of competent officials happens to be in the army.\n\nThis should not necessarily be seen as a fault; in the state of siege we find ourselves in a certain blending of civilian and military power is not only necessary but desirable.

This not only has kneecapped our workers' quality of life but also vastly limited the army's capacity to wage war.\n\nWe will thus institute the first of many five year plans with the core goal of this first most noble plan being the armaments industry.

ZHR_promote_labour_associations_desc:0 "The development of socialism is an organic and slow process. The worker must be forged into a man capable of seizing industry, and, as we have seen in Germany, the Union is one of the greatest tools for his development. Yet, for all the bluster of Gastev, Russia's unions are weak. Sure, Harbin's might have teeth but they were born in favourable conditions. It will not be as easy to plunge their fangs into Moscow or Petrograd.

The west had to struggle and suffer and bleed for knowledge which we can now view directly. We do not have to make all the same mistakes and can peer into their histories for the answer to many questions.

Yet, while the state isn't socialist, it is for socialism. We keep the cause in mind and, when capitalism has grown its fruit and begun to almost rot, we will harvest it and enjoy its fruits in the picnic of socialism.\n\nUntil then, we shall oversee capitalist development, always with the final goal in the back of our mind.

However, if we give without restraint then we would be propping up failing farms, putting our agriculture in a worse place than where we started.

The market is unfair, the socialist screams. The market is destabilizing, the noble protests.\n\nWe have had enough of these parasites. It is time to cast them all aside and liberate the market without consideration for persons.

ZHR_nofreedomforparasites:0 "The Golden Chain of Industry"
ZHR_nofreedomforparasites_desc:0 "For ten thousand years, the human race was poor, bound, and miserable; save for a few geniuses, our history is a history of mediocrity and terror. Five hundred years ago, however, an idea began emerging. Slowly, painfully slowly, was this great system devised. It would be a system based on voluntary exchange and non-violence, in which man would be paid directly for his most important trait: his productive capacity. In its elegant simplicity and raw power, this idea would conquer the world. Stopped at every turn by idiots, we have put the idiots aside and now the chain of necessity will gild our streets. With a truly free market, Russia will not just become a rival to England and America, the twin birthplaces of capitalism; she will become the most industrious, rich, and powerful nation in the history of Mankind."

ZHR_liberatethemarket:0 "Never Another Kishinev"
ZHR_liberatethemarket_desc:0 "When the moronic masses cannot bear their lot in life brought about by their own inferiority, they will do anything to avoid introspection and rational analysis. Instead they will, if of middling intellect, pick up socialism; if of low intellect, pick up religion; and if of the lowest dregs, pick up the most putrid cult of all: race. As Moscow has been in the process of expelling its brightest and even its middling minds for the last half a century, it is no wonder that this cult of race has grown.\n\nWhile we would wish to let these idiots fester in their own delusions of a Jewish elite which rule the world – even in their own minds they place themselves at the bottom – their fantasies have wreaked havoc upon our people, time and time again. The brutes who express this cult, incapable of reasoned thought, resort to bare violence against innocent men and women. As told by uncountable pogroms, ghettos, and expulsions, the history of Europe is a burning question of Jewish existence, with the untermensch of the world chanting no until their throats give out.\n\nIt is time to put an end to all who would wish to drag their betters down into the mud. When you have civilized men fighting savages, you support the civilized men, and the blistering light of civilization has called for a final solution to the Jewish question – an emphatic, eternal, burning word: yes."

No good at all, and in Russia the church is the most vile organ of collectivism in history. It has sucked the wealth from man, and in return, filled his heart with hate and his stomach with want. It is long past the time for the golden altars of God to be smelted down into coin and bullion; the golden cow shall be slaughtered, his sinful flesh turnt to steak.

Alisa Rosenbaum cracked the skies and shook the ground by asking a single word, a question that would fundamentally alter the future of Russia forever: "Why?"\n\nIn Zheltorossiya, faith is dead; the gravedigger is conviction. No more do fairy tales of magic men in the sky, lies of national superiority, or false promises of communal utopia hold grip. In Zheltorossiya, the only belief a man has is in himself, his power, and his will to execute it.

No matter if the king wears red or purple, this dream is impossible because men cannot be made to be free; men can only, by their own might and will, make themselves free. Our liberation will look like none other in history, for we do not propose to shatter the chains of slaves.

When it became clear these were always cheap lies, some discarded both the church and the lie, determined to forge a free future for themselves. Some, however, clung emphatically to the lie while dispensing with the church. This is the sad case of the socialist.\n\nMore sober than the other collectivists of Russia, we had to fight alongside them. Yet they cannot seem to let go of this one delusion, this irrational clinging to a fairytale. We will attempt to free them of this blinder but for now we must make sure they can never again threaten to destroy the revolution from within.\n\nThe Supreme Soviet must be dissolved; too many who threaten the revolution occupy its halls and the entire premise is faulty.

When arms were taken up against this theft, these rebellions were put down; heroes of liberty martyred by socialism. Yet despite the cause celebre of military need, after the Revolution was put down and Zheltorossiya nestled herself in in the East, the theft continued in institutionalized form. Now that we wield the reins of the state, we must make sure that we shall never again let such horrific abuses against the people in the name of "common good" happen again, on any scale. Man cannot be his brother's keeper, lest he end up a tyrant, or worse, dead."

No, the pinnacle of our Objective Revolution is, in a sense, Quixotic; our revolution's greatest achievement shall be the abolition of the revolution. The revolution shall die, and long will live the revolution.\n\nYet this is not to argue that we shall simply revert to the times before liberty's torch cast a warm hearth across Russia. No, instead, the revolution itself shall cease to exist upon completion, as every single man of worth shall instead raise himself up and become his own hero, his own revolution. Our revolution is one of the self, transforming the individual, taking the mud-ape thing and giving it the tools to shape itself into a man!\n\nWhen the first woman took power in the halls of Harbin, there was little expectation. Yet today, with the glistening sunrise filtered through golden windows, Zheltorossiya truly has earned its name. Across the country, men are lifting themselves up, ascending beyond what is menial, becoming heroic exaltations of life itself; with that, Alisa Rosenbaum knows her greatest accomplishment shall be retirement; she shall weep tears of joy upon seeing there are no men left to set themselves free."

ZHR.29.desc:0 "Kerensky awoke from slumber still exhausted. Last week was a cavalcade of new years celebrations and parties, luxurious and opulent with the highest echelons of Harbin society. Some may scoff at the leader of a country spending a week like that, but friendly connections are the grease which keep politics moving. Well that and money. So much money.\n\nAs he arose from bed, he went to his window and looked out over Harbin. Occasionally he liked to remind himself what he was doing all this thankless work for and seeing what the city had turned into over the last decade and a half was certainly a good reminder. This small ramshackle town became a shining metropolis which wouldn't be out of place in the heart of Europe— a beacon of civilization in the Orient. Yet, he couldn't excise a feeling that had been arising in him: dread.\n\nFor the last few months, there had been a dread in his heart, that something was going disastrously wrong that he could not see. Reports of troop buildups in Yakutia, the perennial concern over Japanese encroachment into the economy which has only gotten worse, and now Tokyo has decided it needs to terrorize China. A storm was brewing in Asia and he would be its victim. At least this was what the dread told him.\n\nHe pushed the feeling aside. There was plenty of time to worry but now he could just look out over the city which freedom built. In the warm light of sunrise, all can be weathered. He smiled, got dressed, and left to work."

Walking out into the city street, experiencing the hustle and bustle of the city where men of vision went to free themselves from the chains of mediocrity which the rest of the empire exalted. To breathe in the salty scent of the Baltic Sea. Alas, those days were no more.\n\nShe could still remember the sound of Black Hundred thugs attacking her father's business. The sound of shattering glass haunted her. All for the crime of being well off and having the wrong blood. Resentful scum. While the empire had always been restrictive, the civil war made it cruel. Fleeing east made the most sense to her father and so they trekked ten thousand kilometers; and all for the petty bigotry of the masses.\n\nAlisa Rosenbaum stopped reminiscing. The past was for those too weak to face the future and she was not weak. The property her family lost in Petrograd might have been sizable but the wisdom she gained was worth it all: never trust the mob. In her heart she knew she would regain what had been stolen from her by the parasites— with interest.\n\nWhile the trek may have been terrible, the city she ended up in was not. A dazzling city which grew bolder everyday while the West descended further and further into petty tyranny of the masses. Sure, Zheltorossiya had its own superstitions in the form of socialism, but this was a much more tame evil compared to the horrors that laid west. \n\nShe thought how her life would have gone if the civil war never took place. Would she simply have inherited her fathers business and gone on with its day to day functions? All things considered, it seemed the civil war helped her rise in station, considering she was now one of the highest ranking members of the Supreme Soviet and commanded the minds of hundreds of thousands. Fate seemed to have blessed her."

A Congress of Soviets? Full legalization of all strikes? Complete recognition of all proletarian struggles globally? These were not demands, these were hostage requests.

There was no way he could fulfill a single one of these; Rapture would come before he could fulfill all.\n\nUnless...\n\nMilyukov ran his weathered hands through his silver hair, and a spark ran through his mind.

He would call their bluff and castrate them of their excuse in one fell swoop. A flawless plan!\n\nHe rubbed his tired eyes, pushing his glasses up his face in the process.

Jakob was startled, and rushed to press his ear up against the tinny box.\n\n"Attention, attention: a message from the revolutionary junta! The atmosphere of endless conflicts, misunderstandings, and hatred is wreaking havoc on our community. Chaos and demoralization have brought in the dimensions of defeat.

As provisional leader, neither was his pure ideal; yet this was not a time for pure idealism. The fate of Russian socialism lay in his hands, and Bogdanov had to decide if it would live or die.\n\nThe first was the safer option; simply implement all demands as listed, only letting socialists run, and attempt to reconcile with some of the less bourgeois elements of the Kerenskite Republic. Of course, this had the obvious downside of giving the moderates an advantage — as well as upsetting those to his left — but it might be the only thing that could keep the republic together.\n\nThe second option was riskier. It would be to carry the revolution forward and attack the state as is, to overthrow the existing institutions and relations without regard to precedent. If he played his cards right, then he could use this upheaval to permanently enforce his control. Yet such chaos could play into other factions' hands, let alone the risk it could do to the stability of the republic.\n\nWhether to strike while the iron is hot or to thoroughly cook out rot. What to do with this furnace he'd been given. Bogdanov had a long moment of contemplation, the grandfather clock ticking in the background.

Those men who call themselves reasonable, they wish to see you sick, bloated on filth, dying in the streets!"\n\nGastev whipped his hat around, his hair falling on his face as his mouth launched grapeshot volleys of saliva. The factory men who had toppled Kerensky's government began to join in his furor, matching his tempo and shouting along.\n\n"For years, I have fed you, clothed you, trained you, made you into better men.

Sure, unleashing the dogs had the risk of destabilizing the country, but every move they made seemed to come at specifically his expense, every attack on the "establishment" an attack on him and Vperedism. There seemed to be a hole in his defenses, and he was eyeing out some figures.\n\nWhile there was always the possibility of foreign meddling, it seemed unlikely due to who was spouting it. It seemed decentralized and networked, an outside power would need too many connections. The attack was definitely coming from within the house, and he could find fault in everyone.\n\nHe quickly ruled out an upstart Vperedist, as it was not just him being attacked but the entire wing. Menshevism was the standard go-to, but it would be confusing why they of all people would attack him on establishmentism.\n\nThe OLN was the obvious next choice, but it was an odd line. In the event of his fall, the forces did not point towards them gaining any power. Mensheviks would probably take over the party and rally the actual establishment to reestablish order— unless they had an outside assistant.\n\nChapayev had made no secret of his sympathies to the movement. A general's hand could very well enthrone the party. Yet Chapayev had never struck Bogdanov as a subtle man; if he wanted a crown he'd be yelling for it by now. Still, it made sense.\n\nHe racked his brain for who else would benefit. The minorities were always in a tizzy, but this would not be the line. Anarchists perhaps? Mostly irrelevant. Leninists, maybe? But they're so incredibly weak, how could they command so much attention? Besides, they attack everyone else all the time.\n\nOr perhaps not? He hadn't seen their typical publishings in recent weeks. Perhaps Kamenev entered some sort of secret alliance. This would be a serious breach of party discipline if so, but he had seemed somewhat off recently.

From head of the Bolsheviks, to head of the RSDRP, to head of the Soviet Opposition, to finally head of the revolution. His life had become one sick joke, working under a man who stood for everything he opposed. Yet that had merely been the setup; now the punchline stood in front of him.\n\nAlexander Aleksandrovich Bogdanov’s eyes were bloodshot, his posture was hunched, and his figure cringed and trembled at every insult thrown at him. For the last few days every party meeting had been filled with accusations and insults against him. Some said the revolution was going too slowly, others the revolution was going too fast. One day the peasants were not involved enough, the next day the peasants were apparently fostering counterrevolution.\n\nBut the worst of it was personal. Bogdanov was an agent of the Tsar. Bogdanov was a peon of Kerensky. Bogdanov was a droning dogmatist. Bogdanov didn’t believe in Marxism. Bogdanov was a typical tyrant. Bogdanov was a whimpering coward. He had even heard people on the street shout that he was a vampire.\n\nLev knew every insult leveled against Bogdanov, for he had authored them all. Surviving as a Leninist in the RDSRP had required him to develop a skill for bureaucratic warfare. He used to resent this but now it was being put to good use. He knew how to spread a rumor through proxies, he had perfected his phrase mongering, and when Bogdanov announced that the revolution would rip up the existing institutions, he knew exactly how to use the shakeup to win new positions for his agents and friends.\n\nAnd it had gotten to Bogdanov. He was at the top of the world and yet persecuted by an army of ghosts. He occasionally thought the accusations might be right. What was more likely, that everyone was against him or that he’d gone insane?\n\nLev stared at his haggard leader’s eyes, relishing in his misery as a giddy look grew on his face. Insults flew and Bogdanov’s eyes flicked around in every direction before, by chance landing on Lev. They locked eyes for a moment and Bogdanov’s face shifted from wearied pain to a deranged fury.

He hid his instinctual fear under a mask of baffled confusion, shrugging to the people around him. This only seemed to push Bogdanov further: "Don’t play dumb, your eyes already admitted it to me! You’ve been spreading baseless accusations for weeks! You’ve worked against our entire party! Why? How could you do this to me!"\n\n"Comrade, I’m sorry you believe that, but perhaps you should sit down, you seem… distressed," Lev responded politely. There was a pause in the room as Bogdanov began to process it all.\n\n"Oh I see. It’s about Lenin. I didn’t give a procession for your damned idol’s passing so you decided to destroy me. You decided to break your pledge to the party. You disgust me."\n\nKamenev looked around and saw exactly what he wanted: disquiet, fear and worry, all directed at Alexander. He pulled up his tie and responded: "Comrade, I have made no secret of my fondness for our late founder."Yet these accusations are frankly..."   Kamenev paused for a moment, letting his words hang in the air. "...unhinged. I am unsure how you came to believe I could do such a thing, even if the revolution put a lot of stress on your shoulde-"\n\n"I AM NOT DELUSIONAL!" Alexander screamed, "Do you think you will get away with this? Everyone knows, you can’t hide, you can’t shut me up! You’ll pay for what you have done!" he hissed out before finally looking around and seeing the faces on everyone in the room and seeing their disquiet, "No! No! No! I caught him! It’s so obvious! How could you not believe me!"\n\nWhere there was once Comrade Bogdanov, there was now only a madman named Alexander. He slouched into himself, defeated. He was escorted out of the room, ending the meeting, and his reputation. Afterwards, people approached Kamenev and expressed their sympathies.

The people rule, the people shall rule, and the people will rule forever. The OLN is the party of the people's will, and the people shall be free no matter the cost!"\n\n"If political science, and thus the political program, is not to be based on the immortal and perfect doctrine of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, it could be better called political alchemy. The people of Zheltorossiya shall have their chains broken through the communism of the Bolsheviks as enshrined in 1898 and clarified in 1905, not simple populism and folkist communitarianism!"\n\nOf course, viewpoints besides these two exist, yet the minoritarian Vperedists, Mensheviks, and Right-SRs have already accepted their roles as kingmakers.

Unless he was saying Bogdanov was the revolution; he probably was.\n\n"Conspiracy to enforce archaic bourgeois consciousness by law!"\n\nWhat even was that? Was this trial more than just a stage? Were they using it to cement new ideas? Normalize what could be an accusation? Not like it mattered to him at this point, but it was an interesting thing to ponder in his last couple hours.\n\n"...and incite national-peasant counter-revolution!"\n\nMaybe he should have. If he'd been able to tap into more of the peasantry, maybe he could have done more than launch an unsuccessful smear campaign. He wonders what will happen to Spiridonova.

After some minutes a shot rang out over a silent Harbin and the voice of Aleksei Gastev came over the airwaves. Far from the reassuring voice of a strong leader, Gastev introduced himself almost timidly. He proclaimed the IPK's collective leadership of the Republic, he laid out an ultimatum to the opposition to abandon their efforts at seizing power from the appointed Minister-Chairman. He then named a long list of \"traitors\", his voice was calm and rythmic. He intonated as though he were reading a story book. Once the list was completed, he spoke of the great collective designs of the Proletkult, the great plans for the Republic and the role every single person had to play in the great future of the revolution. Here his calm voice seemed almost passionless, political rhetoric with quiet conviction and no pompous rousing.

There was just something so strange to it all.\n\nWhile idling this political problem, a secretary knocked on his door and interpreted his thoughts.

If the very last words he ever sent to his friend were read or if they would vanish into oblivion.\n\nTime passed. He should have been ready for this day; no man is immortal, and sixty-five was not a spry age. Yet, he had always held the hope that once the republic completed its trek westward to occupy Moscow and Petrograd, he would be able to go to Germany and see his friend's face once more. Now that would never happen.\n\nLev could not rot in his office forever, and after hours of an almost catatonic paralysis, he got up from his chair and went to the restroom. He expected to see his fellow party members in a solemn mood. Obviously, not as broken up as him but still somewhat somber. Instead, no one seemed particularly bothered; occasionally, some seemed almost cheerful.\n\nLev could feel his sadness and pain sublimating into a different emotion. Every lighthearted expression, every smile, every face in this office convinced him of one thing: the Bolsheviks were beyond saving. He had known for years that these machists deviators could not be trusted but now it was personal. This party spit on its founder's face and something must be done to fix it.\n\nOnce he returned to his office, all the energy spent mourning his friend would be transformed into something new.

Those were the days.\n\nYet, she was not looking at some low level narodnik official. Instead, she saw Lev Kamenev. He spoke with an urgency unbecoming of someone of his political stature. Immediately she felt a suspicion flaring up, but she put it down for the moment to hear him out.\n\n"Oh hello, Lev Borisovich, what gives me the honor to see you?"\n\n"I have a proposition for you, but before discussing it in detail, could we please get to a private area?"\n\nThis raised her suspicions drastically but she accented. On the way to her office, Spiridonova made small talk with Lev. He told her about how he was devastated at the passing of Lenin. While she had never particularly cared for Lenin, she nonetheless empathized with the pain of losing a friend. When they got to her office, the man seemed to be almost in tears.\n\n"So, what did you want to tell me that needed this level of privacy?"\n\n"Well, I believe we have a common interest which transcends party lines. That being the dismantling of the Bolsheviks."\n\nSpiridonova was taken aback at this. Why on earth would Kamenev want to dismantle his own party?\n\n"Could you elaborate?"\n\n"The RSDRP is rotten to its core. It has strayed far beyond Lenin's understanding of Marxism but, more importantly, it has strayed far beyond reality. I'm more liable to hear a comrade talk about ending death or building god than actually achieving liberation for the working class. While you and I may have disagreements on how, the OLN now seems to be the only party that actually wants to achieve a revolution for, of, and by the working class."\n\nSpiridonova thought about this for a moment. Kamenev certainly seemed sincere but if what he was saying was true, then he could only peel off a small portion of the RSDRP at best. Yet, even a small group might be enough to finally have the Narodniks eclipse the Social Democrats. \n\n"You make an excellent point, Lev Borisovich.

On the left, Bolsheviks applauded him for exposing those in the congress who couldn't stand for republican unity.\n\nChaos in the congress was not uncommon but usually it calmed down within a minute or two. However, the boos and applause only seemed to be increasing with time as more and more members took a stance one way or another on the Kavkaz Question.

His republic was the final form that all other powers would emulate; the radical changes and uprisings of years past would be replaced with slow and steady reform and change. These republics, lead by a Directorate and a powerful leader, could save the world.\nKerensky had a greater purpose than ever before. His armies and strength would plunge into darkness and come out victorious, cutting of the heads of Bolshevism and monarchism. Fraternal republics would stand free and sovereign once more!

To serve Russia, the soldier must be loyal to Kerensky, the Directorate and the people, and must be selfless in their service to the nation. They must keep themselves detached from all political parties, and should only have the nation in mind when they charge into battle, and not just some foreign ideology exported from France or Berlin.\nKerensky evoked the role of the Levée en masse of the French Revolution when speaking about the nature of the new army. \"Thousand were conscripted to serve, and in spite of everything, they won. The monarchist dogs were repelled and France was saved. We are in the same spot, and thus, require the same dedication and willingness to serve. Otherwise, we shall perish!\""

These were the forges of thought, laboratories of experimental philosophy, where what was previously confined to esteemed colleges was taken up by the working people, to be heated up like fiery steel - to forge intellectual weapons for the new proletariat.\n\nA famous speaker was standing today - a poet by the name of Aleksandr Svyatogor - a middle aged man of the apparition of half a delicate intellectual, half a fierce rebel - this was the man who deemed Futurism to be too antiquarian, not radical enough. He was heard eagerly, while the learned Marxism of many revolutionaries bore the masses, Svyatogor always delivered the most exciting visions. Some were saying he is a futurist thug, some called his beliefs simplistic or nonsensically utopian - but he didn't care and preached his new faith of Biocosmism whenever he could.\n\nSvyatogor began his speech:\n\n \"Comrades, my friends! I have heard voices among you doubting the power of our new revolution. They say \"This is not true communism! Where is the dialectics, where is the dictatorship of the proletariat?\", then others say \"There is not enough freedom! Down with all dictatorship! Dissolve the state now!\". The first type has lost themselves in authoritarian thinking. Why would us, the proletarian body, the volcano of energy, lose themselves in the obsequiousness to the doctrine of the fathers? If you truly desire purity, tend to the spirit! Do not let the philistine slow down the revolutionary tide! For the second type, they raise a much more worthy point - yet they are short-sighted, stuck in antiquated conceptions of freedom, lacking the perspective of a modern man. What is freedom for an abstract individual in a living world? How can a man of gurgling guts and red-blooded veins feed himself on a so-called voluntary association or some union of metaphysical egos? No! We reject abstractions! The living man is oppressed foremostly by the caprice of nature, by that dark force that turns the oozing energy of his muscle, the beating of the noble heart into a feast of maggots! What is the first roadblock to true freedom, and I say it with full seriousness, is our non-divinity! Let's then declare a war on death! Declare a war on nature! Let there be nothing but man, but our will and quest for universal happiness, personal immortality for all! These are the standards our state bears, our glorious State is in itself the realisation of the most base desire of us all, if one truly knows our cause - he already wants to join us.

For the first time in the history of Russia, the conditions have developed to the point where a true socialist revolution is possible, and as a proof of this here we stand! However, if this spark is not to be extinguished by the muddy waters of reaction, special measures have to be taken. Our dire situation demands a look from the scientific viewpoint - the organisational viewpoint.\n\nThe last months have witnessed an extreme intensification of struggle in every sphere of our activity. The blind forces of nature have doubled its assault on the faculties of civilization. The counter-revolutionary elements have mobilised on all fronts. We are living in a period of increased, violent pressure. Some would say that this requires a minimalist solution - that we can't overstretch the expenditure of our energy, that the solution is to wait for a better occasion. But this is not the way of progress! An offensive against the dark powers is needed - only a highly energetic stance can overcome the enemy.\n\nBut I warn you - this is not an easy road, iron discipline and great sacrifice will be required! The current institutions of a democratic republic can't accommodate for the period of intense struggle. Thus, the committee of our Party has already begun the work on a new constitution, that will allow the State and the direction of labour to be taken from the hands of bourgeois directors to a new realm of total organisation!\n\nI do not take this with a light heart - but the stake of our revolution is dire.

He was a party member and initially joined out of sheer opportunism - he thought that by joining the party he would have a safe position at work. However... Something started to change about him. He hadn't felt anything like this since he was a young man. He got up to work as a technician as he usually did, ate his relatively nutritious breakfast and left for work. On his way to work, he noticed again a beautiful mosaic depicting the revolution of 1905, in which simple folk joined forces to defeat the Tsarists. Quite a long time had passed, he remembered that his father had died during the revolution. He winced a little at the mention of his father, but at the same time he felt inexplicably... Warm? Yes, that's a good word. He felt safe and warm in spirit, feeling that he was part of something bigger and more wonderful than himself. How a body cell is part of a beautiful organism. But he shook off the trance and hurried to the building where he worked. Reznikov was surprised, however, because, reaching his position, he noticed that people were waiting for him with a smile, but were not working. He was surprised and walked over to Koycheva, who was helping with the paperwork in the work, as she was the closest. He asked.\n\n\"What's going on, why aren't you working? Has any malfunction happened?\"\n\n\"Oh no, you silly! Today is the anniversary of the 1905 Revolution! The party therefore ordered the celebration and the day off. We are waiting for the parade.\"\n\nWoman replied and Reznikov was confused again as he didn't expect that today is the anniversary of the 1905 Revolution. He scratched his head feeling a bit silly that as a party member he didn't know about the ceremony. They finally heard bells rang, but not church bells, though they sounded similarly religious. The factory workers and management went out to examine the situation outside. They could see a colorful parade decorated with various elements carrying portraits of the heroes of the 1905 revolution (mainly Bolsheviks and sympathizing with them). They hummed and sang "Warszawianka" in an unusual way that to Reznikov it resembled the Church's singing. Behind the procession, the farmers rode their machines adorned with beautiful bouquets of flowers, waving cheerfully to the crowd. Koycheva waved at the farmer, who plucked a beautiful blood-red rose from his tractor and tossed it towards the assistant who blushed and grabbed it. Reznikov also smiled. Reznikov knew what he felt and had lost so long ago - Faith. As a child, he was a very pious child, feeling that the surroundings of icons and priests gave him protection. However, he grew out of Orthodoxy as he grew up. Today, however, he was struck by the same feeling that the working-class collective was for him a safe place free from earthly hardships. Finally he raised his fist and screamed.\n\n\"Long live the communist revolution and long live the Party!\"\n\nAnd his co-workers and then the whole crowd and parades raised their fists in the air and shouted happily chanting after him.\n\n\"Cheers to communism! Cheers to the Party! Cheers to all mankind!\"\n\nReznikov finally felt that he is a part of something bigger and more greater than him. He felt that he finally had a reason in his life and that reason was the fight for a united humanity. He never believed in the whole mambo jambo with resurrecting the dead with the power of science. He thought that everyone will die one day and after death there will be nothing, but you cannot break down and fall into nihilism, but redirect your positive energy into the fight for a new and better world, so that when you die and see the void, you can tell yourself that you were a good revolutionist.

Today I am about to present the conclusive plan our Institute of Energy and Material Research was tasked with preparing - the design of an energetic revolution of the whole of Russia. \n\nOur country is energetically rich by traditional standards - Azerbaijan, Turkestan and Siberia hold great quantities of crude oil, while coal is found all over our country. One might ask: why even go to such heights and waste resources on trying to diversify our energy output? The answers are many: the mere potential of alternative sources and their efficiency, the looming peak of carbon fuel production predicted by American scientists, the pollution and diseases caused by the fumes of coal burning. All of this says one thing, our generation is heralding a new era - one where we have to seriously take our role as stewards and managers of Earth, and if we achieve our goals, the future generations will thank us forever.\"\n\nAs the scientist paused, someone from the committee raised his voice:\n\n\"We all know the theory, comrade Vernadsky - let's get to the practical plan\"\n\nVernadsky replied:\n\n\"Very well - our plan involves practical exploitation of the energetic potential our planet has left us beyond carbon fuels. Namely hydropower and the energy of nuclear reactions. Starting from the latter: as you probably already know, our scientists have made significant breakthroughs in the process of creating a useful atomic reactor. We have found significant amounts of uranium suitable for this operation in Kazakhstan. Our plan involves maximal exploitation of our deposits of this mineral - we plan to open the first atomic power plant before 1950, by 1960 ten percent of our energy should come from the atom, by 1980 it should be twenty percent - and in the dawn of of the new century half of Russia's output should be covered by atomic power. What to do with the other half? The answer lies in the power of our great rivers - Volga, Dniepr, Ob, Yenisey - all of them have immense energetic potential - in the coming years we have to mobilize our labor-power to create dams on these rivers.

The moonlit windows cast a lovely view of the Harbin cityscape, a sight which went unnoticed to the candlelit coupist. For the last week, he had been pouring over every record he could find, engrossed completely in what was dawning on him. Every document that he read, every statement of finance, every trade report, they all pointed towards one blindingly obvious fact: the Republic was owned by the Japanese.\n\nWhile it was obvious Kerensky had become a puppet, it was only now becoming clear that the bourgeoisie, bureaucracy, businesses, and even the banks all had answered to the Japanese Empire in one way or another. The scent of burning wax filled Trotsky's nostrils as his fingers flipped through figures over and over, unable to comprehend how he missed this. Everyone knew the Japanese had a grip on Zheltorossiya; nobody knew it was a stranglehold.\n\nAs the sun began to shine through the smokestacks, the truth of the matter dawned on him. The Japanese had a tentacle in nearly everything; everything but one. The last institution that was free from foreign imperialism was the army. The Japanese had sold their guns and financed their rearmament, but somehow they had never been able to take root. A tired Trotsky rubbed his eyes, his brain frantically calculating how or why the army had been spared.\n\nUnless... perhaps they were simply more organized. Better kept. Of a better class. The Japanese would have every incentive to control the army; yet they failed. The only answer to Trotsky's question was that the virtue of the army, no, the very proletarian nature of the soldiers, was the only force that withstood the siren song of imperialism. Trotsky let out a weary smile, blessed with the truth from the fruit of knowledge. He had found the saviors of Russia."

To reaffirm his firm control over the situation, he would need to get out of his office and into the streets and fields; he would start where Chapayev had his strongest base.\n\n"The necrotic and miserable pseudo-republic which had immiserated our people is over. It is dust, ash, smashed to atoms. With its death, a new red republic can spring forth and lead us to a bright future.

While it wasn't his best speech, he still expected a bit more excitement from the crowd. But he could see what was wrong on their faces. It had been what was wrong in the previous village and what will likely be wrong in the next.\n\nHunger. Hopelessness. Exhaustion. While no one was against him, no one was really for him either; they seemed to lack the energy to have an opinion at all. Every peasant he talked to seemed to lack any vision for the future and just talked of bread; and while the revolution would deliver that, they seemed skeptical; everyone promised bread afterall. The finer details seemed to not even be communicable; he realized too late that very few people would know what an atom was.\n\nEveryone felt tired, ready to give up. Everyone except the soldiers which surrounded him. They seemed ecstatic, their thunderous applause drowning out their growling stomachs.

He inquired with a well-connected coworker if he knew of any illicit sources of his sweet nectar. The risk did not bear fruit; his coworker, Kolya Vasiliev, an apparent true believer, gave him a firm scolding for trying to circumvent the ban.\n\nFor a moment Artur had a sinking feeling he would be reported, or worse, subjected to a lecture about the virtues of Lev the Great, it appeared that Kolya had taken pity on his condition, inviting him to a show instead.

About three-quarters of the way through the play, he realized why he hated the two so much: they were Trotsky. Under the twisted sigil of civilization, they robbed the locals of their way of life and brought nothing but pain.

In return, Artur spat a mouthful of newly-loose teeth at the barbarian before garbling out a protest.\n\n"The Soviet will fucking hang you."\n\nArtur scrambled for his pistol before noticing his arm go limp. He saw the flash and heard the bullet far before he felt the shock of the bullet ripping through his flesh, rending his muscle, shattering his bone. With a clamor, Artur was disarmed, and as the man in the red leather trenchcoat snapped the bolt of his rifle back and ejected the spent cartridge, his face was plastered with a smile that gently let loose a soft whisper of victory.\n\n"Who do you think approved this?""

ZHR.2032.desc:0 "Traitors. Every corner of this country was filled to the brim with traitors. He had let idealism and sentimentality blind him to the obvious fact, that the crisis around Kerensky was not caused by him or an incompetent upper class: it had been caused by everyone. He should have known from the beginning, but his faith in the people blinded him; he would not make this error again.\n\nTrotsky steadied himself, then walked up to the podium, surrounded by guardsmen in case things got heated. He looked over the Supreme Soviet. How many would turn on him with saccharine words and a basic application of pressure? Nakhodka was a small town, and yet a million whispers of treason sprung out of the Supreme Soviet from that alone. What if some agitators in Vladivostok had rebelled instead? Would their Soviet be just as ready to rebel? There was no reason to think they would not have.\n\n"In light of the events in Nakhodka, it has become clear the poisonous roots of foreign espionage and sabotage are still omnipresent in our republic. Until all these are rooted out firmly, we cannot trust democratic institutions to give free and fair results that are not corrupted, as was seen by the treasonous actions by the Nakhodka Soviet. Thus, until the situation is resolved, the Supreme Soviet shall be dissolved and the Red Army will take temporary emerg-"\n\nHe did not get halfway through his speech before the floor became cacophonous—expected, all too expected. He would let them get their protests out now. This seizure was no delicate surgical maneuver. It didn't have to be. Despite his official line, the issue was not that they were foreign spies – the issue was that they were weak. So very weak, like little kittens. Their weakness was their treason, yet all they could do was mewl. Mewl, and mewl, and mewl. Too loud. A quick gesture at his guards and the congress was over. That shut them up – cowards to the core.\n\nTrotsky exited the stage, thinking about what the international press would say. Obviously the domestic press would be controlled, but he knew the capitalists of the world would lap this up. "A Red Bonaparte in Harbin", "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Lev Trotsky", and so on. Every concern, all the hand-wringing over a supposed coup confirmed. Yet he was not bothered. Let them call him what they want. If he was to be a Bonaparte..."
