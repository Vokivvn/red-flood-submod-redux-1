#LEADER DESCRIPTIONS#
POLITICS_YASUHITO_DESC:0 "Prince Chichibu was devastated at his brother's assassination. Ascending the throne in a time of turmoil as suspected terrorists were deported and the Army was reeling from its purge, he set about a ruthless campaign to bring Japan back from the brink of ruin through irredentist conquest of China. Will the young Eigen Emperor's ambitions to live up to his brother outstrip his Empire's limits?"
POLITICS_YASUHITO_GREEN_DESC:0 "Green Prince Chichibu was devastated at his brother's assassination. Ascending the green throne in a time of green turmoil as suspected green terrorists were deported and the Green Army was reeling from its Greenish purge, he set about a ruthless green campaign to bring Green Japan back from the brink of red ruin through irredentist conquest of soon-to-be Green China. Will the young Green Eigen Emperor's ambitions to live up to his brother outstrip his Green Empire's limits?"
POLITICS_KUMAZAWA_HIROMICHI:0 "The Pretender to the throne, a true student of the old-guard, Hiromichi has spent his life asserting his family's legitimacy to the Imperial throne. At last with the reactionary Military leaders having tired of Yasuhito's failures, he has been given the chance to become the Emperor of Japan."
POLITICS_NOBUHITO_DESC:0 "The Emperor Yasuhito's younger brother, the more impressionable Prince Takamatsu. Nobuhito was always much more cool-headed than his brothers and more moderate too. Since the Empire has had its wings clipped, he has become the obvious choice to guide Japan to a more principled place in the Far-East co-operating with Commonwealth interests."

#EVENTS#
japan.1.t:0 "The Sunset Crash"
japan.1.d:0 "How terribly naive we were. The campaign was supposed to be easy, send in the best troops, mop up the Beiyang and ride the high of victory. It was supposed to be the morale boost we needed, to buoy the economy and prevent a crash. But it was a pipe dream. Stocks have plummeted, food prices have risen even higher than before, and business are closing across the country. The Big Four are already planning for massive layoffs, and there are reports of some shareholders killing themselves. The exact reasons for the crash are obvious to those within the Emperor's personal council; the massive investments in military industry and imperial development have left the home islands underfunded, neglected even. No one could say anything, because the philosophy of Sonnō-ha was inherently militaristic, and any attempt to divert spending from the army or the navy was interpreted as anti-patriotic and cowardly. Now, it seems they were cowards not to speak out. Japan's future is now uncertain, to say the least. The situation in China is still precarious and now the Patriotic Vanguard of Okawa Shūmei will most certainly seize on the crisis, so we will need to heavily monitor political activity within the army and the working classes, or else we will fall to communist agitation. The Emperor's reign is now more threatened than ever, and now we must wait to see what becomes of our nation."
japan.1.a:0 "Everything Will Be Fine They Said..."
japan.1.b:0 "Perhaps peace will see us through the worst."

japan.103.t:0 "The Crisis Deepens"
japan.103.d:0 "As the economic freefall continues across Japan, the immediate impact has yet to be felt among the aristocracy. Many military leaders, cabinet ministers and of course the Imperial Family, continue to live in relative opulence. The people have begun to riot in the North, as grain stores run dry and prices soar. Fishermen in Kagoshima and across the Pacific territories are organising strikes at the direction of the Worker's Party agents. It would appear that Japan is past the tipping point. All will take to ignite the nation is a spark."
japan.103.a:0 "Oh no."

japan.2.t:0 "Drama on the Deck"
japan.2.d:0 "It was one ordinary naval inspection aboard the 1st-class coastal defense ship Mikasa stationed at the Yokosuka Naval District, but a conflict between the military police and the sailors soon escalated to a brawl when sailor spat on the face of the inspecting naval military police and declared he, along with the sailors of the Mikasa, were going on strike, before leading an eviction of officers and inspectors back onto the port and sailing off. Since the battleship exited port, many have been analyzing the causes and the conditions of the incident, pointed towards indifference of the officers to the horrible living conditions of the sailors on this 35-year old warship, or extreme corruption within the corps lieutenants. The revolt is believed to be the accumulation of anger among the sailors and their radicalization by several crew members, who are now believed to be members of the Japanese Labor Party. While one revolt is not enough to grab the attention of the nation, many other sailors in Yokosuka are already rising up against their commanders and seizing control of their vessels. Within hours, sailors and dock workers secured the naval base, followed by riots in factories throughout the greater Kanto region later the day. The rebels declared the Provisional People's Council of Japan, and proceeded to march north into Tokyo. Caught off guard as the bulk of the Army is on Chinese front, the Imperial Army hastily ordered the Imperial Guard and the garrisons in Tokyo to crush the rebellion. However, a significant portion of the loyalist forces refused to follow orders due to the control of young officers sympathetic to the Socialist cause. Being bombarded by battleships from Yokosuka, which had been proclaimed the base of operations of the newly formed Japanese People's Navy, the loyalists were overwhelmed by socialists completely within a few hours. The revolutionaries met up in the industrial port of Yokohama where officers and local union leaders joined together. The Japanese revolution begins!"

japan.202.d:0 "The Socialist Forces having taken the edge over Imperial loyalists, have managed to capture the key cities and destroy or win over the soldiers of the Imperial Army and Navy. The Emperor and Royal Family have fled, and the Royal institutions have been seized by People's Councils. The war is over and the Empire has fallen at long last!"
japan.202.a:0 "Long Live The Revolution"

japan.203.t:0 "The Unthinkable"
japan.203.d:0 "At the onset of civil war it suddenly dawned on the Emperor's closest advisors that they may struggle to actually defeat the revolutionaries in a pitched war. While the Empire stands a decent chance of surviving if they can draw out the conflict and drain the will of the reds to fight, it is no guarantee. As such preparations are being made to evacuate the Imperial family, the question remains, where shall they flee?"

japan.204.t:0 "The Revolution Falters"
japan.204.d:0 "With the initial shock passing, our momentum is slowing down. Soon the more experienced and equipped IJA will overpower the militias. Unless we can secure the major cities soon, all will be lost, and countless sons and daughters of Japan will have died for nought."

japan.206.a:0 "Time is running out."

japan.207.t:0 "The Empire's Fate"
japan.207.d:0 "Out of ammunition, out of reserves and out of hope, the IJA has tried desperately to turn the situation around, to little avail.

japan.401.a:0 "Those fools, ready the guns!"

japan.5.t:0 "The Fate of the New Japan"
japan.5.d:0 "The revolution has brought not just a battle between the old monarchist order and the new radical one, but a struggle between fellow revolutionaries. Ōkawa Shūmei has been a strong proponent of a powerful leadership able to crush all dissent and opposition, and his Patriotic Vanguard has been the shock troops of our army during the revolution. He has faced fierce opposition, however, from Hitoshi Yamakawa, a libertarian Marxist and advocate of democratic institutions. He has consistently accused Shūmei of trying to subvert the democratic will of the people and assert his own violent ideology on Japan. In a way, he was right. Yamakawa was meeting with other government officials today when he heard gunshots outside the capitol building. When he looked outside, he saw members of the Patriotic Vanguard shooting at Red Army soldiers. Shūmei had declared the current regime counterrevolutionary and restorationist, and had called upon the Vanguard to overthrow Yamakawa and form a new government. Yamakawa saw Shūmei himself walk forward, ordering the troops forward and singing songs in dedication to the socialist fatherland. He seemed not to care that bullets where whizzing past him. They quickly pushed to the door of the building, and were greeted with more soldiers. They…"
japan.5.a:0 "...were gunned down quickly, and Shūmei and his men stormed the building."
japan.5.b:0 "...repelled the Vanguard, and shot Shūmei during the shootout."

japan.141.d:0 "Among the socialist revolutionaries are many writers and scholars who advocate the use of Esperanto to better connect Japan and her ideas with the wider world. Esperanto being a constructed language designed as a universal secondary language for international communication. Some even go so far as to suggest it be taught as a native language in Japan, the intention being to eliminate Japan's historical closed and Imperial character by transforming it into an open and international one. Sakai Toshihiko and Hasegawa Teruko are two of the more notable advocates, they have been distributing flies and dictionaries across the country at an alarming rate, there is now high demand for Esperanto tutors in Tokyo and Hiroshima. It seems as though the two may be at the fore-front of a linguistic revolution in Japan. The interior ministry has done little to prevent this movement, many among its own staff are also advocates. Some of the more traditional members of the Socialist Worker's Unions have kicked up a fuss however, claiming that these students and petit-bourgeoise clerks are trying to eliminate Japanese culture and identity. Nonetheless the movement continues at pace."

Yasuhito is an honourable and good man, but he is no longer needed anymore. No, what is needed is a firm hand an a re-commitment to imperialism. That means a change in management; a new Emperor, in other words. Pretender to the throne Kamazawa Hiromichi has volunteered himself as the new Emperor, soldiers loyal to us have stormed the royal palace and are starting to build defences in case of counterattack. The defence was heavy, with some of the most fanatical loyalists of the Emperor standing guard. Our soldiers were able to blast through their fortifications with explosives, but with a lot of casualties on both sides. Police officers loyal to the Military Faction have also been working around the clock to preserve order and ensure that rioting and civil unrest is kept at a minimum; we can't allow the enemies of Japan any chances to destroy our nation, be it without or within. Now, all we have to do is hold out and wait for Hiromichi to come to Kyoto. Yasuhito has been surprisingly cooperative; he isn't happy with the situation, but he hasn't been doing anything to resist either. In the meantime, we shall hold on to the last man, for in these desperate times, everything must be done for the sake of the Emperor and the nation."

Furthermore, the total economic crash we've been dealing with is doing us no favors; dissent is growing at home, and soldiers are having a harder and harder time getting the supplies they need to fight. Only the delusional fail to recognize that this needs to end. However, that doesn't mean we can't end this to favor us. The proposal known as the Beijing Compromise, would annex territory up to and including Beijing, giving us a solid base on the Chinese mainland. It also ends the war and gives the warlords the illusion of victory. A win-win! Of course, not everyone is happy with this. The military is still under the belief that they can win this in no time at all, as if the last couple months haven't proven otherwise.

An offer has come forward from the Japanese government offering control of everything up to and including Beijing in return for ending our war.

Thus as their first act they have claimed Formosa as their own, though the Japanese already present are 'Welcome to stay' most have already fled to Ryukyu.

The issue now is what to do with them, they have laid empty for months, gathering dust and squatters. Some believe they should be removed as symbols of the people's oppression, with the many artworks and artefacts being removed to museums first. Some believe that the Palaces themselves should become national museums, celebrating Japanese culture and documenting our history including the revolution itself. There are also some Worker's Party members who have suggested the Palaces be used as private residences for the Municipal Governors and Party Secretaries, though this idea has been met with accusations of Bourgeois behaviour and counter-revolutionary thought."

The centre of the debate is focused on the idea of two women. Itō Noe and Yamakawa Kikue.\nItō takes the stance of keeping prostitution legal so that women across Japan may feel a sense of sexual liberation as well as opposition to traditional and exploitative roles imposed on women by the more conservative aspects of society which shame them (and in many cases kill them in cases of "honour killings") for simply having sexual relations with other people.\nKikue however, views prostitution as a despicable institution which oppresses hundreds of millions of women across the globe. The idea of sexually liberated women to fall under the servitude of men is contradictory with the views of the revolution which supports rights for women.""
japan.32.a:0 "The debate begins."

japan.321.t:0 "Itō Noe Takes The Stand"
japan.321.d:0 ""Comrades, let us reaffirm what the nature of this revolution is. It is a movement that came from the peasantry in the countryside and the workers in the city. Those who stood up against the reactionary and neo-feudal remnants of our Bourgeois past so that we may be free from the chafing bonds of Capitalist and reactionary oppression! Thus, one of the staple parts of our movement, by its very nature, must be the rejection of reactionary views on the woman and on sex!\nSo, I ask you. What is there, more reactionary, more oppressive towards us than the standards and expectations of bourgeois society that have for so many centuries been placed upon us? I have heard many accounts of people in our beloved homeland and people in far away lands being killed in the streets simply for the pursuit of their own joy and desires or (perhaps even more atrociously) due to their need to try and relieve that crushing weight of poverty that came to them through the damnable evils  of Bourgeois oppression. Here we see a system that actively damages those who live under it when they do nothing against it and strikes out with greater ferocity when any attempt of escape is made! I have seen this system be rightfully condemned by all of you here. But one disturbing remnant of our bourgeoise past remains in an unsettling high amount of the people among us. And that remnant is the same thing behind the savage murders of countless innocent people! Traditionalism!\nMake no mistake, I do not believe in the eradication of our nation's culture. But we must recognise that reactionary views that actively suppress the rights and livelihoods of women have no place in our new nation! We must free women of the traditionalist roles imposed on them. If they wish to go to bed with someone out of love before they are married or for the sake of money or for the sake of the very thrill of the act, who are we to say that they shouldn't? Let alone shun them and kill them!\nIt is because of this, that I say that it is essential for us, if we are to stay true to our revolutionary spirit that we oppose any attempt at the abolition of prostitution! And in doing so, finally reject the traditionalist reactionary notions of the past to pave the way for our Socialist state!""
japan.321.a:0 "Let us now here from Yamakawa."

japan.322.t:0 "Yamakawa Kikue takes the stand"
japan.322.d:0 ""Let us make no mistake. One of the principle parts of our movement must be the liberation of women and putting an end to the oppressive restraints placed upon us by the past. It is most important that we oppose it in all its forms. And to me, it seems undeniable that one of these forms is prostitution.\nHistorically speaking, prostitution has never been kind towards women. As my opponent rightfully said, women have been killed for being prostitutes, though what she has ignored is that there are numerable times when the people they are serving are the ones who kill them! Whether this is to escape from the responsibility of paying for their services or out of sadistic perversions does not matter, because either way it shows us that the very act of prostitution will always subjugate the woman. Throughout history, in practically every civilisation, women have been placed in subservient roles to men and the abuse and humiliation that women endure as a result must be something that we must be staunchly opposed to no matter what! If we are to make a nation of revolutionaries and to dismantle the oppression of the pitiful remnants of Imperialist and Capitalist thought, then prostitution must be outlawed!\nBut it is not the women who we must punish. It is those who, at every moment, seek to exploit their suffering for profit. The panderers, the procurers. These petty bourgeoisie dogs must be sent to the wall just the same as everyone else we have taken up arms against! We must work to better the lives of former prostitutes to prevent any want or need to return to such a life. Once we do so, I am confident that there shall be no need or examples of exploitation within our new Socialist homeland! It is undeniable that if we wish to prevent hypocrisy and to prevent becoming the same as the pigs before us, then it is imperative that we take this great step onward to establishing a caring and utopian society. So let us, comrades, stand together to end this madness! Let us stand opposed to the exploitation of women, strike down poverty and therefore strike down the exploitation of women, strike down the petty bourgeois that poison our streets and finally form a society free of all traces of Capitalism and Imperialism!""

The department will also set about translating Islamic works into Japanese and Japanese works into Arabic, Urdu, Farsi and various Turkic languages spoken across Asia.

The Imperial government placed special emphasis on Shintō at the expense of other minority religions. Now, without the Emperor, Japanese society must reconcile its religious allegiances. There are many among the westernised academics at the head of the revolution that advocate atheism. In contrast, the popular sentiment towards these faiths from the general workers and farmers is that they represent the cultural core of Japanese society.

japan.500.a:0 "A decision will surely be reached in due time."

japan.501.t:0 "Onwards"
japan.501.d:0 "While a decision is yet to be reached as the second week approaches, there are things that need very little, if any deliberation. Major cities will be hard to occupy regardless of military resistance, and the Yellow River poses a challenge to be overcome. The army must march, even without a clear direction for the first few days."
japan.501.a:0 "Surely they must have made their minds up!"

japan.502.t:0 "An unorthodox decision"
japan.502.d:0 "As the cold, hard ground of winter slowly gives way to a muddy spring, an unified opinion as well as the decision of His Imperial Majesty has been finally made clear. Japan, for the first time, would mount a major combined arms operation. While a clearly unexpected development that caught the attention of many international correspondents as well as the ire of the old guard, the obvious time constraints facing Japan have pushed His Imperial Majesty to pursue such an experimental approach. The decision of His Imperial Majesty stands clear, despite many shocked onlookers."
japan.502.a:0 "Steel beasts to the fray!"

japan.503.t:0 "Nothing New Under The Rising Sun"
japan.503.d:0 "As expected, the restorationist old guard managed to convince His Imperial Majesty, who was already willing to do so, to follow their tried and true approach. Victorious in Manchuria, Korea and China, their expertise would guide Japan once more through a trying war.""
japan.503.a:0 "The whole meeting was mere formality."

japan.504.t:0 "A Tremendous Victory"
japan.504.d:0 "Through the plains of Northern China, to banks of the Yellow River, the soldiers of His Imperial Majesty have managed what many doubters and traitors saw as impossible, and have brought China under heel. Now, those who would dare use a potential failure as a springboard to their traitorous wishes remain silent, and all that rings is the righteous cries of 'Banzai!' as our righteous army parades through the streets, much to the dismay of usurpers and traitors."
japan.504.a:0 "Tenno Heika, Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!"

japan.505.t:0 "The Nature Of Occupation"
japan.505.d:0 "While China remains occupied, it is important to consider the implications of such a large task. Japan is yet to fully recover from the burdens of our campaigns, yet the occupation proves to be an even bigger drain than the operation. Not only that, promises of a free Asia with the Yamato as its guide would fall flat if the occupation is to go on for longer. A decision must be made."
japan.505.a:0 "Restore the legitimate government of China to their lands."
japan.505.b:0 "Restore the legitimate government, but Beijing must remain under military occupation for full pacification,"
japan.505.c:0 "Despite everything, we still require the land and resources for the greater cause."

japan.520.t:0 "The Niceties of The Red Tape"
japan.520.d:0 "As the size of the army remains still too large for the necessities of the operation, orders get confused, reach wrong places, munitions run low, and yet time keeps on moving. As things stand, the apparatus is too cluttered to move on."
japan.520.a:0 "It can't be helped."

japan.521.t:0 "Not Enough Guns, Not Enough Butter"
japan.521.d:0 "While a rifle is not complete without the man shooting it, some extra ammunition and rations would clearly help said man. Unfortunately, the troops remain below capacity for a full operation, and without a good supply train, they risk even being encircled as they move deeper. Thus, operations naturally slow down, while time, sadly does not."
japan.521.a: "It can't be helped."





#CUSTOM TOOLTIPS AND FLAGS#
JAP_SETTING_SUN_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan is a glass cannon. Since its close victory to a bloodied and hubristic Russia in 1905 the military has been the relief valve on an increasingly divided society. Conquests in the pacific and exploitation in China are propping up a fragile economy. The young Emperor Yasuhito has doubled down on the ultra-nationalist policies his late brother was wary of, embracing the likes of Araki Sadao and eradicating the last vestiges of liberal democracy. A war to bring Beijing to heel has now begun in earnest, but if the campaign fails, Japan risks the Communist Party rising up against the ruling Restorationists and starting a civil war..."

JAP_gunji_sangikan_kaigi_desc:0 "The Meiho era dawned in January 1932 after the tragic assassination of the Showa Emperor by a Korean terrorist, and the ascendance of His Current Majesty the Emperor. Now, the Gunji Sangikan Kaigi -- the de facto inner cabinet of the Emperor since the Meiji Restoration, has become the de jure inner cabinet. Completely free of any bureaucratic or political meddling, it has become the true and only advisory body to aid the Emperor through trying times, be it the holy war in China, or the unrest at home."

JAP_planning_advance:0 "Planning Our Advance"
JAP_planning_advance_desc:0 "Despite differing opinions by all the generals attending the conference, one thing shines as bright as the sun above -- This war cannot be prosecuted recklessly, and one can not simply walk into Major cities like Taiyuan, Beijing, and Xi'an. Plans must be made, and the holy war must be prosecuted systematically, lest Japan leads her soldiers to their deaths."

JAP_radical_suggestion:0 "A Radical Suggestion"
JAP_radical_suggestion_desc:0 "From the meeting, one thing has become clear. Time is limited, funds to prosecute this holy war are drying up, and the enemy is becoming more and more entrenched in their position. Combining skill on the offence with the latest technological developments, a clique of unpopular, yet brilliant officers from the fledgling technocratic clique propose that every single dime Japan has is to be spent to deliver a decisive blow with fire and steel."

JAP_continuing_as_planned:0 "Continuing As Planned"
JAP_continuing_as_planned_desc:0 "As enticing as using the latest technology and crushing the enemy with a storm of fire can seem, the realities of war are deeper than what the new school of officers are accustomed to. Japan fought through Northern China and Korea forty years ago -- and such tactics there have brought us victory. Thus, there shall be no changes made. The foundation of experience Japan has acquired over the years shall be built upon instead of risking defeat by using novel strategies."

JAP_overcoming_hurdles:0 "Overcoming The Hurdles"
JAP_overcoming_hurdles_desc:0 "A change as fundamental as the ones proposed do not happen overnight -- the army's experience in armoured warfare is limited to the involvement in the Russian Civil War and the Northern Expedition. There is much to be learned, and there is no time for extensive programs. Divisions will have to make do with the experiences learnt in the field, and incorporate them into their doctrine quickly."

JAP_airforce_coordination:0 "Air Force Coordination"
JAP_airforce_coordination_desc:0 "Armor is not enough to overcome fortified positions. Without support from the air, any advance will eventually come to a halt as enemy reserves regroup and form new defensive lines. Therefore, extensive use of the air force to pinpoint artillery locations as well as to deliver fire from above to destroy the enemy's willingness to fight and shatter their cohesion shall be the second piece to complete victory."

JAP_army_streamlining:0 "Streamlining The Army"
JAP_army_streamlining_desc:0 "In maneuver warfare, it is critical that orders reach their recipients in the shortest time possible. Getting rid of military-bureaucratic bloat will be essential in this endeavor, making sure every order reaches their targets without bothering with extra steps, as well as freeing up equipment and reserves for the grander operation."

JAP_independent_tanks:0 "Independent Tank Brigades"
JAP_independent_tanks_desc:0 "Getting rid of bureaucratic bloat is simply not enough -- The spearhead of the attack must be made independent from the infantry. Orders must reach them at lightning-speed, their advances must be covered by mechanized infantry, and they must have direct support from air units. Only and only then will this campaign be finished in due time."

JAP_breaking_the_tide:0 "Breaking The Tide"

JAP_securing_key_points_desc:0 "The situation in China is dominated largely by a few fortified key points, and the connections between those aforementioned key points.

JAP_large_front_operation:0 "A Large Front Operation"
JAP_large_front_operation_desc:0 "The offensive carried out by the Japanese army will impress even European observers with its scale and severity. Scouring the landscape and attacking at every point reasonably will at best take the pressure off of our main forces aiming for strategic and political objectives, and at least it will see troops advance into territory adjacent to the main battles. This will be the leg sweep that displaces the enemy's center of gravity. This will be our determined push towards victory"

If they can, however, then all the deaths so far will have not been in vain and glory will be well won. One last magnificent strike, for the Emperor!"

JAP_knowing_our_enemy:0 "Knowing Our Enemy"

JAP_multiple_prongs_desc:0 "Control of the azure depths of the Sea of China as well as the golden waters of the Yellow River are essential if the soldiers of the Emperor are to succeed in their prosecution of this holy war.

So long as they stay under control, further advances into enemy territory shall proceed smoothly."

What's another hour of snoozing compared to the advantage gained by sending squadrons to perforate the enemy's defenses and percolate to vital supply depots? Much of the enemy's munitions have been captured and shall be used for this purpose. If spotted out of the corner of their eyes, infiltrators may have an extra second of doubt to exploit. A small advantage, admittedly, but any measure must be taken to ensure operational security. The main fighting force will recognize their brothers in arms after breaking through enemy lines by white armbands, dotted with the blood of the enemy."
