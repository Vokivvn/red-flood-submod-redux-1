#LEADER DESCRIPTIONS#
POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the collapse of Germany and Russia following the Great War, Poland would be reborn out of the ashes from centuries of foreign domination. Led by Marshal Piłsudski, Poland was able to overcome and defeat the threats surrounding them, and realize their geopolitical goal through the formation of an Eastern European defensive pact called \"The Intermarium\"". It has been over 15 years since this however and Piłsudski has gotten old. Bed ridden from cancer, few know how long he will live, but everyone knows it is only a matter of time till the Great Marshal loses his final battle."
POLITICS_PILSUDSKI_DESC:0 "It is a near-impossible task to find a man more successful in recent years than Józef Piłsudski. Despite his humble revolutionary beginnnings, the Commonwealth's Naczelnik has risen above everyone else, and utterly transformed the state on his way.\n\nHis most important fight of all, though, was with his polar opposite: Roman Dmowski. When Piłsudski saw the Tripartite Pact as a means to independence, Dmowski thought that Russia filled that role better - and history would have almost proved him right, were it not for the Russian people themselves, who revolted against the despotic Tsardom. This spark was enough to light up the West, and so, Piłsudski took up arms together with the people of Poland, Belarus, Lithuania and Ukraine, and nearly succeeded in fulfilling the goal of uniting the four nations. The streak of good luck continued, as the threat of a revanchist Germany laid dead with the victory of the Revolutionaries and the subsequent dominance of the SPD.\n\nMentioning only his geopolitical success, however, would be omitting half of Piłsudski's achievements. For he and his loyal men included nearly every patriot in his grand project - the Sanacja. The organization aims to mend the Poles and their politics, divided by over a century without a state to call their own. Even in the massive political bloc his authority is unquestioned, and as his legend grows and his government achieves success after success, some say he's \"as lucky as Augustus, and as good as Trajan\".\n\nLady Fortune, however, cannot keep smiling forever. The Naczelnik is not only old, but also has been struck with a terrible illness. The SPD's dominance in Germany will eventually wane, and rumblings in Russia indicate that the dozing bear may soon roar back to life. As Piłsudski's health deteriorates, his mind is filled with the whispers of what still lies unachieved, and if his labours will be enough to last. Who his successor will be, and if they can be the Augustus to his Caesar, only time will tell."

At least that's what it looks like on paper. The organization does not consist only of Piłsudskites, but also of Young Nationalists from Zadruga, Anarchists, Syndicalists, various intellectual and artistic circles, Freemasonry, Social Democrats, Democratic Socialists, Communists, Futurists, Old conservative Landlord Aristocracy, and former members of the Endecja that betrayed Dmowski after his alliance with Stolypin.\n\nBut even Piłsudski's closest associates are united only by loyalty to the Marshal. Walery Sławek, Ignacy Daszyński, and Edward Rydz Śmigły wage internal wars for influence with each other, which devour Sanacja like subcutaneous rot. Each of them has a different vision not only of the ZBSR but also of what the future of Poland should look like. Of these three, Piłsudski's successor will most likely be selected, but it is not certain whether a new unexpected player will enter the game, who will upset the established order."

poland.1.desc:0 "The public worries as our great marshal and head of the state Józef Piłsudski hasn't left his home for two weeks. His poor health has been on decline for few years now but it has never left him strapped down to bed before. Many claim that we have to prepare for the worst."
poland.1.a:0 "The nation prays for him."
poland.2.t:0 "The Death of the Marshal"
poland.2.desc:0 "What everyone feared the most has finally happened. At an age of 69, Józef Piłsudski, our dear Marshal of Poland has died after a long battle with liver cancer. He left behind grieving family and a nation on a crossroads. While nominally democratic, Poland was practically ruled by him with his influence being an open secret. Now that he is gone, no one is truly sure what can happen."
poland.2.a:0 "Let us remember his successes and mourn his passing."
poland.4.t:0 "The Gathering of Emergency Government"
poland.4.desc:0 "The entire sanation bloc is troubled by questions, \"What to do now? Who should take the reign?\" Should it be the current government?, now freed from dictatorial power? Will it be able to democratize the nation and bring its citizens freedom and prosperity? Will it be the army? A Military takeover might be necessery to prevent chaos from shaking both Poland and the entire Intermarium. Or may there be... a third option? A Fresh and dynamic movement, developed over the years in the fringes of Piłsudski's camps. While seen as crackpots by their opponents, the organisation seemed to be fiercely loyal to marshal and thus deemed harmless and not worthy of persectution. It meanwhile grew using ideas of socialism, nationalism and anti-imperialism to gain supporters from seemingly opposing camps. Lead by controversial artist Stanisław Szukalski and an even more controversial philosopher, Jan Stachniuk. Both promising to bring Poland to greatness never seen before in its entire history..."
poland.4.a:0 "It is clear that the Marshal's work is done, we will be a democracy."
poland.4.b:0 "The Marshal's death must be harnessed and Poland propelled to greatness!"
poland.4.c:0 "Our enemies will take advantage of our mourning, bring forth the military government!"
poland.3.t:0 "Marshal laid to rest"
poland.3.desc:0 "Crowds of size not remembered in ages gathered in city of Krakow to pay their last respects to the Marshal of Poland; her leader Józef Piłsudski. Despite some resistance from members of the catholic clergy that holds the historic building in custody he was burried in vault under Wawel Cathedral, the traditional place of rest of Polish kings and national heroes. Flocks of grieving Poles were accompanied by numerous foreign guests including official envoys from member-states of the Intermarium alliance as well Prussia and the U.K. More insightful eyes could also spot controversial Russian politician Alexander Kazembek amongst the guests."
poland.3.a:0 "May he rest in peace."
poland.5.t:0 "A Controversial grave"
poland.5.desc:0 "Death of Marshal Piłsudski emboldened his political opponents. Group of protesters gathered today before parliament building in Warsaw demanding removal of Piłsudski's body from Wawel vault claiming that the funeral was done against wishes of both the Catholic Church and the Polish nation. The illegal demonstrations were ended by police and some of the activists were arrested. There has been no official response from the Polish Episcopacy."
poland.5.a:0 "This doesn't bode well."
poland.6.t:0 "Artist riot"
poland.6.desc:0 "Unexpected unrest started in Krakow's Academy of Fine Arts where argument between groups of students over philosophical matters turned into open clashes. Supporters of classical academia and critique engaged in violent fights with acolites of Szukalski and his more free-spirited and less academic aproach to art. Debate was espacially heated becouse of political implications of the given arguments. Luckilly police was easilly subdue unruly student and everything ended without serious bodily harm to either side."

Debate was espacially heated becouse of political implications of the given arguments as well as Szukalski's position within goverment.

Pro-academia students as well as some teachers expressed concern over police treating Szukalski's supporters way more leniently."
poland.7.a:0 "Art is born in pain."
poland.8.t:0 "National Pantheon"
poland.8.desc:0 "After many debates and revisions finally began first works on the \"Duchtynia\", a national monumental building which is to serve as crypt of proudest sons and daughters of the Polish nation as well as her spiritual center. Grand concrete structure designed by Leader himself is to be a seamless hybrid of ancient slavic burials and cutting edge architecture and technology. Despite work being more than likely many years from being finished, construction is already attracting criticism as a \"pagan temple in a heart of catholic nation\" as described in an official letter from Archbishops."
poland.8.a:0 "Wonderful way to honour our identity and our heroes."
poland.9.t:0 "Dawn of a democratic coalition"
poland.9.desc:0 "The election carried out by temporary government resulted in Ignacy Daszyński, leader of Polish Socialist Party, claiming the title of the president, as well as many members of both wings of the Polish Popular Party getting seats in the reintroduced parliament. Despite that, Poland still needed major changes before she could be called a free democratic country. So in order to ensure that reforms will be passed with little to no resistance from right-wing extremists and national collectivists, PPS, PSL-\"Piast\"" and PSL-\"Liberation\" formed the Democratic Popular Front and as a result have taken majority of both the senate and sejm."
poland.9.a:0 "Could this be the beggining of our freedom?"
poland.10.t:0 "Augustus the Strong"
poland.10.desc:0 "Cinemas across Prussia and Poland hits \"Augustus the Strong\" (German title: August der Starke, Polish title: August Mocny), a polish-prussian cooproduction. The epic is praised by critics for historical accuracy and attention to details in life of the german king of Poland. It is also seen by both sides as an attempt at warming relations between two nations. \nSadly premiere didn't went completly without incidents as acts of vandalism to the poster displays in some cinemas were reported. Clear link with communist activity isn't yet established but highly suspected."
poland.10.a:0 "May this be a symbol of a growing friendship."
poland.11.t:0 "Island of Sages"
poland.11.desc:0 "Premiere of the last episode of the awaited \"Island of Sages\" (Wyspa Mędrców) movie serial didn't went without controversy. While adaptation of the first book in the series under the same title was praised for high production values and acting chops of Witold Roland as main antagonist, some criticised it as \"blantant propaganda\". Director, Leonard Buczkowski demented the accusations stating to be merely faithfully adapting source material which is already few years old. \"Was Maria Buyno-Arctowa trying to flatter current goverment writing her book eight years ago? If yes, powers of her mind are more superhuman than those possesed by her characters.\" Buczkowski answered in a press interview."
poland.11.a:0 "Wonderful series, as always."
poland.12.t:0 "Great findings in Biała!"
poland.12.desc:0 "In village of Biała nearby Lódź archeologists discovered an ancient relic: urn used by ancient slavs to burry ash of their dead. Well preserved artifact is covered in enigmatic symbols that will surely give our historians something to argue about and artists to spin into rushes of creatvity."
poland.12.a:0 "This will help us learn about our past."
poland.12.b:0 "Another pagan junk to the collection."
poland.13.t:0 "Writing Reform"
poland.13.desc:0 "Today marks the date when official Commission on National Font begins its works. While government is working tirelessly in its efforts to industrialise the nation and colectivise the farming, cultural aspect of transformations cannot be underestimated by no means. Alongside reform of education making it more suited for future poles well aware of their cultural and ethnic heritage, proposed was also smaller but quite interesting development. \n Unlike nations like Germany with fraktur or Britain with Gaelic script, Poland never managed to show its uniqueness by establishing suited for its language typeface. And how with merely using western tools can we create not just literature made in Poland but true Polish Literature?\nCommission emploing finest artists and grapical designer alongside scholars of polish language will try to create elegant typeface to use both in pring and handwriting. One at once simple, elegant and uniquely suited for specifics of our language."
poland.13.a:0 "Our language is yet to be at it's most magnificent."
poland.14.t:0 "An offer from the other side of the sea"
poland.14.desc:0 "An interesting but controversial offer has come to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Stanisław Szukalski, the Polish commander sent Tbilisi a proposal for a joint pact against Kolchak. Immediately, the heated discussion in the foreign ministry spilled over to the rest of the government buildings. It would certainly be a great help to bring the revolution to the rest of Eurasia, but it could also look like a betrayal of this revolution. In the End Zadruga seems to be an ordinary bourgeois government like that of Artaud with the addition of paganism and quasi-socialist politics. Economic aid from Intermarium and lower tariffs between the two countries would also help in the development of the Kavkaz economy. Officials' opinions were divided. Some believed that such a decision would lead to betrayal by Poles, whose propaganda for the last twenty years has focused on attacking all Russians, so even if Kavkaz is transnational they could attack Kavkaz after Intermarium would stab the black heart of Kolchakocracy.\n\nHowever, it was necessary to make a decision and finally the application to the Presidium regarding the offer from Warsaw was carried out. The vote was held at an express pace and it was decided by a majority of votes that…"

poland.102.desc:0 "Polish troops entered Konigsberg quite quickly, crushing all resistance of the Prussians and showing that their militarism manifested itself only at parades. As in the inhabited times, when the Lechites fought against the Germans or in 1410 when the Poles, Ruthenians and Lithuanians crushed the Teutons, now the Intermarium won. Luddendorf's bandits will be tried for their crimes. \n\nHowever, other problems arose. Berlin started asking Warsaw what it was going to do with the huge population of Germans. Szukalski and Stachniuk did not show hostility towards the Germans, so it was decided that the talks would pass peacefully. \n\nThe Poles invited the representatives of red Germany to Gdańsk, where it was agreed that in exchange for Królewiec and permanent low customs duties on the border on goods brought to Królewiec, the Germans promised to carry out a population exchange, leading the Germans out of Silesia, Pomerania and Masuria and also much more favorable for the Intermarium trade agreements were established for the import of coal and food from the Intermarium areas to Germany and Hungary. Such a move is to allow both sides to completely obliterate all age-old disputes and forge an alliance that will oppose both Russia's reaction and the madness of France."
poland.102.a:0 "Pole and German two good cousins?"
poland.103.t:0 "Historical exchange"
poland.103.desc:0 "We watched the developing situation in Prussia with anticipation. Intermarium troops entered Prussia to regain Gdańsk and Masuria and to protect themselves against a possible backstab by Prussia during the Polish-Russian war. It was an understandable move, but at the same time the Poles had promised us earlier that they would not try to take over Prussia for themselves. It was a disturbing move, but at the same time we did not want to judge Warsaw of vile intentions. \n\nWe expressed our willingness to discuss the Prussian issue with the government of Stanisław Szukalski. We were afraid for nothing that this famous ultra-nationalist activist and eminent artist would reject our offer, but to our surprise Sanacja accepted our request. After the Poles conquered Königsberg, we started negotiations in Gdańsk. \n\nBolesław Piasecki chaired the talks. The Polish side insisted on keeping all of Prussia in Polish and Lithuanian hands, but in the end we convinced them that a better solution would be lower tariffs on the border and population exchange, and additionally more advantageous trade agreements for Intermarium in exchange for giving Königsberg to us. Poles will lend us their railroads to transport goods to Königsberg and in return they will receive land and national unity. The talks were long, but they symbolize the end of the war between the Slavs and the Germans forever."

poland.51.desc:0 "Surprisingly successful is a recently published book by historian Wacław Anczyc under the title \"Endless Sky\". A significant departure from the academic works Anczyc has produced throughout his career, Endless Sky is a collection of allohistorical short stories set in an Europe completely rearranged by an even more successful Genghis Khan. The Great Khan who in Endless Sky is declared the prophet of Tengri not only reaches France with his conquests, but also codifies the Tengriist faith leading to its proselytization in the Mongol Empire. The massive upheaval caused results in a second migration period leading to poles (under the banner of the Semi-Mongolised 'Lechite Horde') settling in eastern Germany and Slavs reaching as far as the region we know as Denmark. The stories aren't directly linked with each other by any recurring characters and take place in vastly different countries in the 15th century such as: a syncretic Tengri-Pagan Lithuania; Rani, the Slavic settlement in Denmark; The Holy Roman Empire, relegated to Germany's Rhineland; A united Iberia, where the Mohammedan and Christian unite against their common Heathen enemy; and the marginalised Papal State suffering greatly from loss of legitimacy rivalled by dozens of Anti-Papacies set by the remaining Christian states and some even by Mohammedan countries. \nStylistically the work is surprising for an author with an academic background; quite light, accessible, and depicts an implausible reality masterfully detailed by the author."

If we only focused on production of goods, cannons or planes we would be no better than communists in Germany who do the same. No, our most sacred, most divine goal is to rekindle the living flame of the spirit of Poland and whole of Slavdom that for centuries smoldered giving out barely any light. This flame needs to burn bright, scorch rotten leaves of the centuries past that our men and women drown in. But how we can even attempt to start such revolution when the very words we use are not of us but about us? How a Slav is to revolutionise something when he doesn't even have native word for such revolution? Our vocabularies are filled to the brim with useless trinkets we collected out of dumpsters of other nations. Mere garbage others throw away we treat like relics of higher cultures. A potato, a cucumber or a palace suddenly becomes more noble, more thoughtful when we name in a way others do. Latin, french, german, english and even jidish are for poles True Languages that our crooked speech of quaint hicks can only borrow from. \n\nNO MORE!\n\nWe shall purify our language and through this pure language we will finally be able to communicate Slavic thoughts in Slavic way. A special commission will be established sniffing for unwanted aliens in our language and replacing them with native words. All government approved publications, broadcasts and movies will be obliged to comply with the reform ensuring faster spread of the corrected language.\nOf course a heated debate rages on within the movement on how far the reform should go. Should we bring the heat of the purifying flame to the older works or words of the dead bards are sanctified by their notability alone? How far should we go with the reform? What languages are close enough to our own to make borrowing a mere sharing of common Slavic speech among brotherly nations? Those debates while sometimes heated shall pass in time bringing us to a consensus and more so to our goal."

The occupying forces couldn't simply destroy our spirit for the soul of a Slav is a tree which roots dig deep into the soil of the Earth. Instead they used subversion to harness those rituals to their own means. But luckily the ritual and the love of the common man is still strong within our nation.\nTo the surprised relief of some of the farmers and silent horror of some clergy we not only didn't try to prevent the celebrations, we made sure that this year ones will in whole country be remembered as the most exquisite, most elaborate and life-affirming anyone ever remembered. Not for nothing we are a movement of planners and artists: not boring speeches and dry sermons but vitalistic theater, awe inspiring songs and performances, elaborate costumes and decorations brought into the fields of our villages rekindled pride of the common man. Pride in his nation, his race, his ancestors and his accomplishments. We didn't prevent the clergy from bringing in their shallow and boring babble into the celebrations for not only it would give them so desired sense of victim-hood that the "Black Internationale" of the cosmopolitan church of Rome feeds off but also would not allow people to see how dwarfish, malformed and senile their efforts truly are."

The threat of Intermarium stands vanquished, but an age old question remains: Quo Vadis? Or rather, where should the Polish nation go from here? It will be a Poland of might and justice. A self-governing kingdom in an union with our glorious Empire, as it always should have been. Piłsudskis' lunatics might have tainted the vision of a truly national Poland through their masonic machinations, but nothing is beyond repair. Soon a new Poland will rise from the ashes of what they had destroyed, stronger than ever before. But who shall lead it?\n\nOn the forefront, Boleslaw Piasecki is a young man with new ideas, a voice which many hope will inspire a modern generation of Poles to take our side. Taking the teachings of the Union of Young Russia as his own, Piaseckis beliefs mix industrialism and radical nationalism. Though popular with the Polish exiles, many worry about his unconventional ideas thinning the line between nationalism of Warsaw and that of Le Soleil.\n\nZygmunt Cybichowski leads the new guard of National Democracy and his appointment would fulfil the promises we had made years prior, though his ideas are much more radical than that of the recently departed Roman Dmowski. A radical republican opposed to the “3 don'ts” – Spartakism, semitism and freemasonry, Cybichowski takes his notes from various books in Europe where Dmowskis expertise is lacking, such as our Black Hundreds or the Romanian Iron Guard.\n\nFinally Stanisław Kozicki is the most orthodox choice, Member of the old guard of National Democrats and one of the men who had lobbied for the formation Dmowszczyzna, the agreement between Dmowski and Stolypin which would ensure the formation of a Polish autonomy within the Russian Empire. Such a decision was seen as blatant collaborationism then however, and his appointment would likely not sit well with much of the general population. Nonetheless, he serves as the most reliable cog to our machine, being the most accommodating to whatever direction Russia pursues as long as Polish interests are not trampled along the way."

A proper democratic republic, following in the footsteps of 1569 and 1918. Piłsudskis lunatics might have torn this dream apart through their misrule, but nothing is beyond repair. Soon a new Poland will rise from the ashes of what they had destroyed, freer than ever before. But who shall lead it?\n\nStanisław Mikołajczyk is the most obvious choice, a staunch agrarian and an organiser for the rights of the peasantry, his bid for the presidency would appeal to the sections of the lower classes still struggling to accommodate to the realities of our rule. His obvious sympathies to Berlin and fellow traveller status within the old regime are more than enough to raise a few eyebrows, however.\n\nRoman Rybarski is another option, however polary opposed. One of the leading theorists of Polish Nation Democracy, a movement that had largely operated in exile ever since the Sanationalist coup d'etat, Rybarski treats the fine little between the movements anglophilia and russophilia. A staunch liberal nationalist, his ascension would be a bone thrown to both sides of this double-edged sword of Polish oppositionalism.\n\nLast but not least, Tomasz Arciszewski is a London minded social democrat, frontman of the Polish Socialist Party of which Pilsudski was once a member as well. Their relationship had not been warm for years however, as Arciszewskis followers were one of the first Poles to speak out against Sanations blatant seizure of power. A self-styled patriot, his flavour of patriotism is nonetheless much less radical than that of his former companions. Viewed by some as the least offending choice and a return to early steps of Sanation by others, he is the most polarising option by far."

The old Berlin elite might have put the final nail to the coffin of this ideal by accommodating Pilsudskis lunatics, but nothing is beyond repair. Soon a new Poland will rise from the ashes of what they had destroyed, more equal than ever before. But who shall lead it?\n\nTadeusz Peiper is a futurist with a small F, a leading member in the nations avantgarde and a minor bureaucrat in the former Sanation regime. His appointment would set Poland on a path of soft rebranding, retaining the economic policies of Sanacja while moving away from the ideas of Prometheism and strongman leadership. He wishes to syncretize a model of futurism-communism not too dissimilar to that of Kavkaz with Polish nationalism, bringing Poland to a new, modern age.\n\nMieczysław Moczar is something of an idealistic young man, leading a minor organisation styling itself as the Polish answer to National Vanguardism. His militaristic strain of Bolshevism merges with the pro-catholic and nationalist policies of National Democracy, a paradox he sees fit to put himself on the forefront of resolving. Often spicing his speeches with what mirrors the antisemitic rhetoric of more anti socialist Polish nationalism, many suspect there is more to his brand of “Proletarian Nationalism” than what meets the eye.\n\nJózef Cyrankiewicz is a functionary of the Berliner kind, an old dog communist with a knack for clearly defined procedures and keeping to political theory. His rule would follow the formation of a coalition of parties with the now fully spartakized PPS as its head, integrating many pre-Sanation tendencies in properly entrenching its rule. A competent statesman who only opens his mouth when he knows he's allowed to speak, his leadership would serve us well in building a comfortable foothold into Europe."

The threat of Intermarium stands vanquished, but an age old question remains: Quo Vadis? Or rather, where should the Polish nation go from here? It will be a Poland of land and justice. A republic born out of the people’s sacred will, aided by our wise guidance. Piłsudski’s regime made the mistake of driving a wedge between the Slavic peoples, but nothing is beyond repair. Soon a new Poland will rise from the ashes of what it had destroyed, more just than ever before. But who shall lead it?\n\nOur first choice is Jan Dębski: a major politician in the radical left of the PSL party, the main opposition group to the old Sanation regime. He is a representative of the populist agrarian movement sympathetic to our cause. It is this movement that he speaks for, and his plans include nothing more but fulfilling its program: reducing Piłsudski’s breakneck industrialisation and urbanisation policies, conducting a radical land reform, and bringing the fruits of modern welfare to the countryside. In return for autonomy in Poland’s internal matters, he would prove a loyal supporter of Russia on the world stage, with a large support base of peasants provided.\n\nAnother player in the occupation government is Bolesław Bierut: an odd figure, he’s close to Jan Hempel, a theorist of the left-wing faction of the neo-pagan Zadruga movement and remains deeply influenced by his thought. Beirut’s vision represents nothing less but a synthesis of anarcho-syndicalism with Polish-Slavic nationalism and folkish mysticism. Following the word of Hempel, Bierut wishes to combine what he terms an “Aryan” Old Slavic spirit with a maximalist communist project of liberation of the world proletariat. He spins colourful visages of workers freed of the darkness of Christianity, coming together to worship life itself. A regime like his could become highly unstable, and his rhetoric plays dangerously close to the tunes of Zadruga, but maybe it is revolutionary fire that Poland needs to recover from national humiliation?\n\nLast but not least, there is general Lucjan Żeligowski. A committed pan-slavist since youth, Żeligowski expresses an enthusiastic desire to bring Poland and Russia closer together again. However, Żeligowski remains loyal to the ideological guidelines of Sanacja - in which he sees a system, that once purged of the anti-Russian sentiment that brought the brother nations to a disaster, will guide Poland into a glorious future as a modern, united and disciplined nation. Overall, Żeligowski seeks to continue the policies of Piłsudski’s nationalistic, industrial socialism aided by a new rhetoric of freedom and unity of the Slavic race. Żeligowski’s strong hand will certainly bring stability to the Polish nation, and his slavophile fervour will make sure that an eternal alliance will unite our peoples to walk towards the glorious future together."

It is necessary to improve relations with the Ukrainian nation as well as invest in these areas so that we are able to prepare for the attack of the Muscovites."
POL_friends_belarus:0 "Memories from Nowogródek"
POL_friends_belarus_desc:0 "From the territory of today's Belarus comes one of the greatest national bards - Adam Mickiewicz, it was he who predicted the resurrection of our state and the forging of the Polish nation. It is also the basis for the Belarusian nation, which, like us, declares its will to create a new, stronger state free from oppression. Our friendship with Minsk lasted a long time and we should maintain it. Fortifications in the Belarusian marshes will allow us to defend ourselves against mosquitoes and the construction of new industrial complexes will stimulate the economy of Belarus"
POL_undecided_bulgaria:0 "Expedition to Woruta"
POL_undecided_bulgaria_desc:0 "Contrary to Ukrainians and Belarusians, Lithuanians feel cold to our nation, accusing us of similar crimes committed by the Russians. However, we must not get nervous. We should show that the Lithuanian nation is independent of Poland by correcting the mistakes of the Dmowszczyzna, but at the same time we guarantee freedom and rights to Poles in the borderlands. A good start of our cooperation would be the opening of an excavation in Vilnius to discover artifacts from the times of Voruta and Gediminas, as well as signs of Polish-Lithuanian friendship"
POL_between_east_west:0 "Between East and West"
POL_between_east_west_desc:0 "Our position between between ever ambitious and power hungry powers of east and west does not need to be our death sentence. Careful preparation and decisive actions be it in war or in diplomacy will be our salvation."
POL_two_germanies:0 "Legation to Branibor"
POL_two_germanies_desc:0 "Despite our caution towards our western neighbor, we cannot deny that Germany is much less aggressive towards us. We cannot allow ourselves to be diverted by some disagreement on trivial matters. Especially since we have a common enemy that is Moscow. Both we and the Germans do not want to fight on two fronts, so by securing our western flank we will not only gain from trade, but also we will not have to be so afraid that our neighbors will stab us in the back."
POL_memories_commonwealth:0 "United in Hate and Faith"
POL_memories_commonwealth_desc:0 "Not only do we feel hurt by the Muscovites, there are also others who show their emotions secretly and fight in the shadows. We should support all independence movements, especially those in the Baltic, which, inspired by our movement, will not go against our will. At the same time, however, they will do quite a lot of damage to our common enemies by wreaking havoc and ferment."
POL_military_order:0 "Military Restores Order"
POL_military_order_desc:0 "With Marshal's death country is at the edge of chaos! Only swift army intervention can save it. Isn't it how Piłsudski did so in the first place? It's only suitable that after his death Poland be taken under protection of military clique. Military Council of National Salvation will ensure safety and prosperity of our citizens."
POL_sharing_rights:0 "Sharing Rights and Responsibilities"
POL_sharing_rights_desc:0 "Military Council needs to properly solidify its rule and properly codify rights and responsibilities of its members if they plan to rule for longer than just short emergency.

POL_united_spirit_desc:0 "We need to build proper authority of the goverment and convince people that it represents interests of Poland and ALL its citizens.

POL_martial_law:0 "Declare Martial Law"
POL_martial_law_desc:0 "Poland is at the edge of disaster. With Marshal's death whole sanation coalition is about to collapse as well.

POL_pressure_lithuania:0 "Pressure Lithuania"
POL_pressure_lithuania_desc:0 "Lithuanians are our Achilles' heel when it comes to defense against Russia, it is necessary to convince them to change their attitude, otherwise they will be seen as our enemies. We should start with anti-Polish sentiments among political parties that actively attack the large Polish population in Lithuania. Piłsudski was too gentle with Lithuanians and we are going to wear an iron glove when dealing with them."
POL_ultimatum_byelarus:0 "Ultimatum to Belarus"
POL_ultimatum_byelarus_desc:0 "We built their economy, equipped their army, and stabilized their country. Belarus owes its freedom only to us, unlike other Intermarium countries, they show at least a little gratitude, but it is not enough. We are connected by practically everything, so it can be said that our countries are one. In practice, however, Belarusians still reject the idea that they belong to the same nation as us. It is time to change their mind and persuade them to join Poland peacefully, otherwise they may face unpleasant consequences."
POL_ukrainian_gambit:0 "Ukrainian Gambit"
POL_ukrainian_gambit_desc:0 "Kyiv has always resisted our will, during the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and now… Petliura allegedly supported Marshal Piłsudski in the fight for liberation from the Moscow occupation, but the Ukrainians use the Intermarium and Poland as a way of profit. When the dust settles after the difficult fight with the Muscovites, Kyiv will stab us in the back. They claim the rights to eastern Galicia and sometimes even areas as far as the Vistula! We must end this idiotic gibberish about great Ukraine."
POL_migration_wilno:0 "Migration to Wilno"
POL_migration_wilno_desc:0 "Vilnius consists of about 60% of the Polish population. Despite strenuous efforts to reduce the Polish population in Lithuania, the local Polish community was able to endure pogroms, broken windows, harassment and expulsion from their places of residence. Vilnius will be expanded and modernized so that Poles from this hub will be able to colonize the rest of Lithuania easier. We will slowly try to Polonize Lithuanians who still hold a grudge against us, but with time (and with investments in Lithuania) these sentiments will fade away."
POL_polish_administrators:0 "Establish Polish Administrators"
POL_polish_administrators_desc:0 "We are looking for collaborators, but we cannot find the right people everywhere to manage local areas. So we have to change our behavior. Finding local and patriotic military and civilians to carry out the duties of controlling newly annexed territories is much easier. Certainly, these administrators should stabilize friendly relations with local people, but also actively assimilate them. Administrators from Poland will, therefore, promote Polish schools, Polish businesses and show that Belarusians, Lithuanians and Ukrainians are in fact Polish brothers and sisters blinded by Muscovites."
POL_belarus_integration:0 "Belarussian Integration"
POL_belarus_integration_desc:0 "Belarusians, anyone else remembers them? They speak funny broken Polish, but write in the Latin script, pray in Roman and show the Russians' antipathy. This is enough to be Polish. After the annexation of Belarus, we found many collaborators, because the Esers lived mainly thanks to us, so many of them, desperate to maintain the status quo and their luxurious life, immediately contacted us when we entered Minsk. Belarus will take some time to integrate, but we do not expect to encounter any major resistance."
POL_ukrainian_integration:0 "Ukrainian Integration"
POL_ukrainian_integration_Desc:0 "Ukraine is already a harder nut to crack than Belarus and we can see some bigger problems. Despite the visible Polish influence in right-bank Ukraine, the Ukrainians still want to stick to their ridiculous identity. We cannot act as boldly as in the case of Belarus, but at the same time we must be firm enough not to allow any separatist movements. We will order the army to scour the fields and forests in search of Ukrainian guerrillas, and we will have to find suitable collaborators."
POL_baltic_direction:0 "Baltic Security"
POL_baltic_direction_desc:0 "The Baltic governorate was cut off from Petrograd and Moscow causing even more chaos than in other parts of Russia. Estonian and Latvian guerrillas are wandering in the woods, communists and German aristocrats are fighting with each other, and the Russians are unable to control the chaos. It is therefore necessary to intervene to secure the Northern Front. Cutting off the Russians from the Baltic ports will plunge them into even greater hunger and economic collapse. If we starve the Russians and cut them off from the world, we will defeat them more easily."
POL_steppe_direction:0 "Steppe Direction"
POL_steppe_direction_desc:0 "The Great Eurasian Steppe stretches from Vladivostok to Ukraine. In addition to the valuable land that can be used for farming, the steppe is an ideal place to attack. We secured the Baltic by cutting off the Russians from contact with the world, so it would be good to also secure the southern front by a preventive attack on the SEU. This will allow us to better control the black sea, which will not only further make Russia independent of us, but also allow us to get rich."
POL_czech_claims:0 "Two naked Swords"
POL_czech_claims_desc:0 "Before we set off on our greatest and deadliest enemy, which are Muscovites, we must finish off our final biting pest, Prussia. From the very beginning of the Teutonic state, the Prussians were waiting to attack us. Even now, when Prussia is in such poor shape and only resembles the splendor of its glory which was the Duchy of Prussia and the German Empire, these vermin are trying to stab the knife in our back. Russia turned its gaze from Konigsberg, focusing on uniting the heart of darkness and Prussia remains unprotected, however, if we tried to attack Russia, Prussia would certainly enter our land, trying to rape, loot and burn our lands. This dread of Teutons is over, it is necessary that we challenge them in the fields of Grunwald and that we drive two naked swords into German soil."
POL_strike_russia:0 "Just Like in 1612"
POL_strike_russia_desc:0 "When we united the territories of Greater Poland and created one great and powerful state that no one would dare to attack. So here we only have the option of enlarging the borders of our country. Only Russia is able to threaten us at the moment. But that will change soon. Germany is too busy with France to stab us in the back, and Russia is mired in internal strife. So it's time to hit the Kremlin and raze it to the ground like in 1612. "
POL_reform_army:0 "Reform the Polish Army"

POL_steel_oil:0 "Steel and Oil"
POL_steel_oil_desc:0 "XX century cannot continue without us. Advancements in science, military theory and industrialisation made modern battlefield unlike those we knew before.

POL_window_world_desc:0 "Gdynia is our window to the world, which allows us to breathe the fresh sea air of freedom. Gdańsk will sooner or later be taken away from the Prussians who are trying to eradicate all Polishness from their lands. Currently, however, we need to strengthen our only window to the world, the expansion of the port will not only allow us to develop trade, tourism and colonization actions, but will also provide us with a basis for building the Polish navy."
POL_defend_gdynia:0 "Defend Gdynia"
POL_defend_gdynia_desc:0 "The corridor to the sea is necessary for us to survive. There are ports in Odessa or Memel, but even with friendly relations, Lithuanians and Ukrainians will impose huge fees on us. Gdynia is our own port, so we cannot afford to lose this dynamically developing city and a great opportunity for the Polish economy. "
POL_modernize_underwater:0 "Modernise the Underwater Fleet"
POL_modernize_underwater_desc:0 "Submarines are cheap and quick to produce, which under our conditions is necessary to ensure the dominance of the Baltic Sea. At the same time, submarines are also a good counter for the larger ships that Russia is betting on. Modern submarines will be a truly deadly ace up the sleeve of the Polish Navy."
POL_new_age:0 "Into a New Age, with New Ships"
POL_new_age_desc:0 "General Gustaw Orlicz-Dreszer created the concept of a Pole and a tamer of the seas who, lashing the waves, floats like a bird in the air. This thought should guide us while modernizing our navy. We must not lag behind Russia, Germany, France and Great Britain, but we must make the Poles rule and conquer the waves. It will be a titanic task comparable to the work of Sisyphus, as we do not now have the appropriate capacity to produce a huge navy, but as we develop our country, our fleet will grow with it."
POL_protect_convoys:0 "Protect the Convoys"
POL_protect_convoys_desc:0 "The main reason for the construction and development of Gdynia was trade. We cannot allow our convoys and cargo ships to be destroyed during the war, therefore, in line with the chosen maritime doctrine, which focuses on small, cheap ships. We intend to expand the destroyer fleet to effectively protect our maritime trade."
POL_skies_poland:0 "To the Skies of Poland"
POL_skies_poland_desc:0 "Just like Daedalus and Icarus, Poles are also paving new routes, the whole of Europe is delighted with new airplanes, so we cannot be worse. The first Polish combat aircraft took off during the Intermarium-Russia war and many airmen returned to Poland. It's time to call them back into service, this time as aviation teachers, to train a new generation of aviators. For this, there is a need for new air bases and training centers, therefore it is necessary to increase funds for Polish aviation enthusiasm."
POL_wings_freedom:0 "On Wings of Freedom"
POL_wings_freedom_desc:0 "Aviation gives us the possibility of such freedom that was never possible before. However, how can our aviators look proudly sipping sweet freedom as they fly in the machines of the previous decade? It is necessary to increase expenditure for engineers ready to design prototypes of flying machines. This will allow us to inflict heavier wounds on our enemies ourselves, limiting the mortality of airmen."
POL_like_storks:0 "Just like the Storks"
POL_like_storks_desc:0 "Our airmen not only fly on modern and fast machines, taking advantage of very good training, but they themselves show willingness to take part in the battle and in the fight for the homeland.

POL_claim_slovakia:0 "Never Another Golden Bull"
POL_claim_slovakia_desc:0 "Konrad Mazowiecki, in his stupidity, invited the Teutonic Order to our lands, asking them for help in the fight against the Prussians. When it turned out that the Teutons, instead of ensuring their contract and accepting the payment that the king wanted to pay them, took over the territories of Prussia, the Roman Emperor Frederick II issued a golden bull giving the lands of Prussia and part of Polish lands to the Teutons, the black international led by the pope repeatedly confirmed the idiotic claims of the Teutons to our lands by releasing another golden bulls. No more nonsense. Just like in 1410 as our willpower and blades smashed the Teutonic Knights and 1525 forced them to obey, and now we will show that their prayers will not stop our weapons and dynamite"

We will crush the Red and White Tsar, and a free world will arise on the ashes of their inhuman rule."
POL_rally_austria:0 "Meeting on Prometheus Rock"
POL_rally_austria_desc:0 "The Bolsheviks differ from us in many ways, but not in their envy of the Tsarists and the servants of the dead god. We should abandon our differences for at least a moment and focus on fighting one enemy with our common forces. We have to gather new allies and not argue stupidly. We will invite the Kavkaz leadership to talks in their capital city to agree on the Intermarium-Kavkaz relations and, additionally, to agree on trivial matters such as the reduction of customs duties and investments to show them our good intentions, thanks to which we will gain their support in the fight against the Tsarists."

We're going to declare war on these beasts and stop them from going west once and for all. Poland has always been a stronghold of Europe in front of these animals and now we will show the Muscovites what our ancestors did in 1610. Moscow and Petrograd will be under our control and our children will never have to fear the Russian carcass again. We will avenge the brutally murdered past generations and at the same time create a new and better tomorrow!"

Polish scientist is no worse than those of Europe or America but just like the polish soldier he lacks necessary funds. And while normally it would be a matter of merely national pride, current dire situation on the world stage makes being more advanced, more prepared a matter of life and death. Allocation of required funds towards military research should give us an edge we are in a dire need of."
