The Shah's grand reforms on the late 1920's and early 30's have petered out and costs are mounting. This has combined with increased British interests in the petroleum industry and rendered the state a mere slave to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. This misfortune and shame has set the stage for a radical shake-up in Persia, one that the Shahdom would do well to survive."

per.101.desc:0 "The latest incident happened in Ilam. A city well known for its oil production, it also happens to be full of Kurds  - flashpoint for violence and ethnic strife if ever there was one. While the sequence of events remains unclear, we have gotten a rough understanding of what's going on. Apparently, some onion vendor in the city was plying his wares when he got into a fight with an Englishman over the prices. While both blamed each other, the incident was used to spark a major protest that grew into a riot. Unfortunately, some socialist elements in the mob directed them to attack a prison and to free the onion salesman, claiming him to "A hero opposing the tyranny of Britain and the Shah". This shouldn't be a major cause for concern if not for the fact that the socialists not only blame the British for the arrest of the innocent onion salesman but have risen to attack their offices and anyone who so much as speaks English, pelting them with rocks and symbolically onions.\nBelieving him to be the ringleader, we secretly had the idiot onion salesman sneaked back to Tehran for interrogation, and we're going to discover the full extent of his plans. Numerous parts of the country are rioting, much of it stirred up by the socialists. The British ambassador also made a personal visit to the Shah, informing him that his nephew had been "greatly insulted" by some "vegetable merchant" and demanding justice. Still, we believe that we can salvage this by interrogating who people on the streets cheer as the "Onion Revolutionary" and working out the full extent of his little plot to overthrow the Shah. Worse still, communications have slowed down and a number of cities administrations are crippled by the spontaneous solidarity demonstrations."

Following the many humiliations and cruel occupations by foreign tyrants such as the rugged Russian bear or that accursed lion of Albion, the once great empire of the Near East has fallen from a regional hegemon and the protector of the Shia faith to another forgettable and impoverished rump state.\nIt was taken for granted that the fall of these giants following the Great War would bring prosperity to Persia. But despite the collapse of the British raj and the Russian Civil War, we fell only further. Revolutionaries, opportunists, secessionists and their marauding bands of thugs and savages, wandered across our lands and carved it up into many different states and nations. British troops, in response to the vacuum left by the collapsing Russian Empire only tightened their grip on Persia, leaving us unable to respond to the injustices in the West.\nThis only intensified in the following years as the loss of the Raj fueled British demand for Iranian oil, leading to the Shah becoming little more than a puppet with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) effectively controlling the country. The lack of checks and balances on the influence and strength of the APOC has had the deeply concerning side effect of pushing workers, peasants and nationalists into the hands of Socialist movements in reaction to Capitalist agitation and exploitation of Persian territories. Support for the socialist menace has achieved its strongest forms in ethnically Non-Persian pieces of land that miraculously did not break away in the 20's. A state of affairs that has made the situation far more dire as it risks not only unacceptable political change, but also risks the territorial integrity of the already beaten and mutilated body of Persia.\nIt seems undeniable to many that in the coming years, the Jewel of the Orient will either fall to the red flood or use it's conquerors to crush it, even if it may come at the cost of total integration. Nothing however, is ever for certain. And only time will tell what God has in store for us."

Attempts have been made to stymie the state Bank-e Melli-ye, as it affords Tehran the freedom to fund the Shah's modernisation projects such as the Trans-Iranian railway. Not yet completed, this railway represents the problem with British control of our economy - progress is too slow and far too uneven. Persia has a choice to make - shall it continue the course and work closer with London to build the nation in the Commonwealth's image - or shall it strike out alone and attempt to break the British yoke? The choice is yet before the Shah as negotiations over Persia's debts and investments have yielded a new proposal. Under this new economic deal APOC will increase oil production at a marginally higher royalty rate, in turn Persia's interest will be reduced and the Imperial Bank will hand over power as the monetary authority in Persia to Bank-e Melli-ye upon payment. The catch of course is that if payments are missed, the terms of the deal need not be upheld, creating an opportunity which apears to be double-edged. Refusal will maintain the unsatisfying status quo, and allow the Shah freedom to manoeveur at the cost of British security guarantees. But the deal is a tempting offer with the promise of further investment from the British in future on the line. If British influence receeds, some wonder if the Russians will simply take their place."

Demands as outrageous like these ought to cost people their heads. But APOC is no ordinary entity. It's deep connections to the British Empire mean that action against them could throw us into conflict with the Anglo menace. A fate that none are eager to see come about. The reasons APOC cites for these demands are based mainly on the rising threat of war in Europe and how Britain needs easier access to Persian oil fields in order to fuel their vast navy and rapidly expanding air force.\nBritain and the APOC have also been quick to remind us about our debts to the United Kingdom from various loans that we have taken throughout the years, and that Britain would not hesitate to force out payment from us should the need arise, no matter how harsh the actions may be.\nThese debt obligations give us little choice in the matter.

We simply cannot let another Iranian hegemony happen in the region, not to mention letting our rightful lands out of our hands, but the shah seems fanatical about his claims, and who knows how could an Iranian-Afghan conflict end for our country.\n\nWe have 12 hours to respond to this ultimatum: we either hand over the territories or we show Tehran that we're not afraid to face them."

These parties and jubilations were inspired more by the end of conflict after months of brutal fighting and the deaths of tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians alike.\n\nBut these celebrations were marred by concern and melancholy. Only the most naive of the nobility could have ignored the undertones of severe crisis within the court of the Shah. Workers and nationalists across the Persian nation were still furious at foreign domination over the Shahdom. Alongside this, the civil war had left the nation battered and bruised, countless cities had been raised to the ground by the constant barrages of shrieking artillery, famine had broken out in many parts of the country leaving as much as 200,000 dead. And perhaps most importantly, the White armies loyal to the Shah are left exhausted, short of supply and under-equipped. The Shah was all too aware that the root of absolutist power throughout history came from the authority of a standing army. With that gone however, the integrity of the Persian nation seemed vulnerable to say the least.\n\nThese fears were quickly confirmed when a few delegates from the United Kingdom and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company arrived in the court of the Shah along with an entourage of a few hundred soldiers guarding them. The delegation approached the Shah with demands to cede considerable amounts of power to the APOC in Iran as a form of guaranteed payment due to the massive debts that the Persian nation had undertaken during the Civil War. The APOC has reasoned that the conditions of Persia are so poor that the state has become functionally insolvent. In order to ensure that the APOC receives its dues, they have outlined demands which amount to Company rule over the entirety of Persia. There will be no facade of independence this time around, no slight checks and balances on the APOC's influence.\n\nThe delegation had expected that the audience chamber would burst into outrage and fury against them as had happened so many times before, but surprisingly were met with sorrowful silence. The court knew all too well that rebellion against the APOC and Britain would be impossible. The nation had suffered too much from the civil war to offer resistance, the once proud armies of Persia were now disorganized, battered and exhausted messes. It had become all too obvious that resistance would only inflict far more suffering onto Persia.\n\nIt is because of this that the Shah and the rest of the court by only a slim margin and with a heavy heart had agreed to cede to the demands of the APOC. Persia has now been forced into the annals of history and in its place arises the relic of company rule. An idea that was thought to have been dead since the rebellions of 1858 in India. Already industrialists and Capitalists are flooding into the new corporate state in what has been termed as "The Capitalists playground", sights of extravagant casinos, hotels, and new Civil Lines are already appearing in newspapers across the world, overshadowing the carefully discredited claims of brutal crackdowns.

Without their monopoly or even presence in one of the most oil-rich regions of the world their investors have pulled out and the company has gone under, officially ending decades of oppression and exploitation of Persian land and people.\nThe Communists themselves were hardly a unified force, being composed of a large coalition party made up of the Hezb-e Jangal, the Iran Party and the People's Mujahideen of Iran. But despite the many splits between the Communists forces have been largely ignored as the streets of all but the most conservative villages of Persia have been flooded with song, celebrations and much cheer at the downfall of the British puppetry of their nation and that symbol of three thousand years of autocracy known as the Shah.

While this may seem inoffensive, it is important to note that this shows that the many factions of Communist Persia will have to make sure of the path they take and the implications it will have, not just with the expectations of other factions but also the will of the people.\nStill, the question of the exact path that Persia will go down now that it has become the latest stronghold of Socialism in the world is not one on the forefront of many people's minds.

The people that fought for the revolution were unified in a desire for routing foreign domination over Persia, but this does not mean there was any form of general agreement on a specific ideology within Socialism that the Persian Revolution ought to follow. Now that the celebrations and jolities of liberation have begun to  subside, it is time that we address the issue of leadership.\n\nFor the first time in the nation's history, Persia had become a true democracy. Not one fitted with the liberal illusions of democracy which seek to only keep the Capitalist in power while giving the illusion of popular will. No, Persia had become a true democracy, one where the old feudal institutions hold no sway over the worker! With such massive upheaval, we could only have hoped to follow the will of the people by holding free, nationwide elections! Naturally, reactionary parties were forbidden from running and those with connections to Pro-Shah forces were not allowed to vote either. But other than those necessary restrictions on anti-worker groups there were no restrictions on who could vote.\nThe elections had been filled with a myriad of different parties and independents. But the election was dominated by two main factions. The Jangal Party, led by Mirza Kochak Khan and a broad coalition calling itself the Tudeh led by Reza Radmanesh. The Jangal Party was originally a sepratist organisation, waging a low-level insurgency in the Northern parts of Persia, now they espouse a more nationalist rhetoric, being strong supporters of both the liberation of the people and the ideal of an Iranian Republic. The Jangal party's aims are for the immediate development of the productive forces via industrialisation of Iran, so it may rise up from being a feudal desert, into the Tiger of the Orient. Additionally (and more controversially), the decentralisation of the nation into a socialist federation of all Iranian peoples. This platform is further made popular among more conservative minded voters by the party refusing to take a secularist stance. Rather than hold a specific religious doctrine, the Jangal insist that Islam can and will work alongside socialism. The Tudeh meanwhile is a far newer organisation, being formed from various Socialist and Marxist councils, many of whom were the ones that fired the first shots of the Revolution and war of independence against the Shah and the British. The Tudeh wish to re-take the lands that the Shahdom lost while also seeking to create a new type of Socialism, a form of "Syndicalist-Agrarianism". Unique to the material conditions of Iran. Controversially, the Tudeh also wishes to standardise the Persian language as lingua franca across minority populated regions in order to ensure that such acts of subversion cannot happen again.\n\nAnd so, after weeks of campaigning from both sides, the nation holds its breath as representatives of the worker councils walk into the First Session of the Workers Council."

Namely, the question of moderation.\nThe approach that the Tudeh had been taking to the question of the management of Persia had been one of moderation. The Tudeh since its inception had been a party that was divided into two camps. The moderates, who argue that because Persia is an agrarian and pre-industrial nation and therefore lacks a dominant industrial and urban proletariat. As a result it is imperative to push for an agrarian based platform and for agrarian reform throughout Persia. And the radical Socialists who believe that if Socialism is to be successfully developed in the nation of Persia, modernisation and industrialisation is a necessary step that must be taken in order to develop the productive forces of Persia as a whole and in doing so, secure the revolution from outside threats and advance the power of the proletariat and the standard of living in the nation as a whole.\nThe Tudeh was therefore forced to toe the line between these two groups, pursuing a more moderate platform in an attempt to reach a settlement between the two factions. In the days before the civil war, this division had not been as dominant. But now, with no immediate foe to unify against, the question of moderation has come up once again, with the current path that Eskandari and the Tudeh had been taking failing to satisfy neither party. The discontent is at this stage so great that the moderates have threatened to split the party if their demands for the addressing of agrarian concerns are not addressed in the next set of economic plans.\n\nEskandari has therefore mandated the total recall of all ministers back to their respective councils, to ensure that there is accurate representation of the will of the councils as a whole. After this process is complete, for now it remains to be seen which of these factions shall end up dominating the Worker's Councils, but whoever the victor may be, it is certain that the destiny of Tudeh shall be radically altered."

While there has been much agreement over the importance of nationalism, whilst rejecting racial and cultural chauvinism, as a means of serving the revolution and resisting imperialism. There has been much disagreement over the extent that nationalism must be considered and elevated within Persia in relation to Socialism.\n\nMore nationalist factions within the Jangal have argued that as Persia has only ever really developed Feudalism and has not yet even come close to the adoption of Capitalism as the primary mode of production. The countryside is dominated by outdated forces of production such as hand held tools and draft animals, few cities have access to modern industrial production and the situation is generally speaking, totally backwards. Therefore, the current path that the Jangal is taking, of purging and dissolving the Bourgeoisie classes within the nation, is deeply flawed and problematic. These factions preach for working with the National Bourgeoisie to develop the productive forces of Persia and from there establish a Socialist nation.\nMore Orthodox groups within the Jangal however have denounced the nationalist factions of the Jangal as revisionists and even counter-revolutionaries. Citing the fact that the entrusting of the development of the nation to working with the bourgeoisie risks the relapsing of the revolution towards Capitalism as opposed to building a secure road towards Socialism. Orthodox Socialist factions have also argued that a great leap forward from feudalism to Socialism has been proven to be possible, as was observed from the nation of Hungary under the leadership of Leninists such as Bela Kun or the Socialist movements within Bulgaria, who had come from a largely feudal and proto-capitalist condition into a Socialist one within just one or two decades.\nThere are still however many elected representatives that have yet to side with one faction. This lack of a clear majority has led to a small crisis, leading to Mirza Kochak Khan calling for an election within parliament  within the month, with no option to abstain. The decision has been controversial as it was decisive, with protests and complaints being quickly raised in parliament. Nevertheless, the government has made up its mind and all eyes rest on the Jangal to see the road that it will take."

By issuing new shares to sell to the notables of Persia, we can raise funds for further investment, and also align their interests with our own."

PER_engineering_civl_service:0 "Engineering the Civil Service"
PER_engineering_civl_service_desc:0 "It is no longer sufficient for us conduct ourselves as a resource extraction agency, hiring a tiny percentage of the Persian population to extract resources for sale abroad. We need Civil Servants of all types in the model of the old India Civil Service - and applying the newest scientific management principals to the process of government. "

PER_lessons_from_ford:0 "Lessons From Ford"
PER_lessons_from_ford_desc:0 "Ford has his eccentricities, but even more impressive than his survival of the American depression is his successful management of labor opposition. We have taken detailed notes on these (and other) strategies for scientific work planning, protecting the well-being (and purchasing-power) of workers, and controlling potentially dangerous labor movements; the time has come to implement them."

PER_education_according_to_plan:0 "Education According to Our Plan"
PER_education_according_to_plan_desc:0 "While for the moment, the Persian people are too exhausted by war to seriously challenge our rule, we cannot expect this to be true forever. As such, we much very carefully design a new curriculum for mass education. Eliminating illiteracy be a boon to our economy, but more critical is that we ensure the next generation knows that we are bastion of order and prosparity in a world gone mad."

PER_native_offices:0 "Native Offices"
PER_native_offices_desc:0 "We cannot afford to frustrate the ambitious young men among the Persian people. Far better that we instead co-opt them into our power structure, allowing them to earn positions over their countrymen by advancing our goals, and tainting them beyond any easy association with nationalist or communist elements."

PER_new_propaganda_drives:0 "New Propaganda Drives"
PER_new_propaganda_drives_desc:0 "The APOC is the savior of Persia! It was we who delivered this land from the backwards decadence of the old government, and when the demonic communists rose to destroy Persia and Islam, we sent them back to hell. This message shall be made clear to all, a first line of defense against any recurrence of Marxist thought."

PER_pay_off_royalists:0 "Pay off Royalists"
PER_pay_off_royalists_desc:0 "The Monarchy is now irrelevant to the interests of the Company, and it is in the interest of the remaining relevant officers in Persia, especially native ones, to do away with loyalties to the former Monarchy. Now, whilst this would be hard through complex conversations, it can be made much, much easier through bribes."

PER_soldiers_of_fortune:0 "Soldiers of Fortune"
PER_soldiers_of_fortune_desc:0 "It has become clear that we've fended off against war in our shores. Our surrounding nations have no animosity or claims against us, and our lands find themselves in immense peace. Therefore, to maintain our economy lubricated and going perfectly, we should be using up all these mercenaries coming here to maintain order as soldiers across the World's conflicts, receiving lots of money and glory - of course, with a little share to us."

PER_investigate_strategic_deterrence:0 "Investigate Strategic Deterrence"
PER_investigate_strategic_deterrence_desc:0 "Standing armies are expensive, especially the portion which we cannot deploy on profitable oversees contracts. Historically, the need for a defensive army is unquestionable, but recently we have heard something interesting.  New weapons, so destructive as to render any possible aggression too costly to continence. While this seems far-fetched, this possibility is too tempting to pass up all-together."
