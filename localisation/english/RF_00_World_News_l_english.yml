news.intro.t:0 "Welcome to Red Flood"
news.intro.d:0 "In 1905, when the guns fell silent in the Far East, the Russian Empire had won a pyrrhic victory over Japan. Stability still eluded Russia, however, as the 1911 assassination of Tsar Nicholas II would show. Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin would take advantage of the weakened House of Romanov to further his ambitious economic modernization program.\n\nThis would all be put to the test when the Empire intervened in the Balkan Wars in 1913, marching an army through Romania to aid its Orthodox brethren in Serbia. Treaties and guarantees went from words to material facts, and soon Europe was embroiled in the Great War. Years of industrial warfare unlike anything seen before would change the course of history forever, and by the end, very few states could count themselves as victors rather than victims.\n\nThe year is 1936. In 1919, one year after the red flag flew over Berlin, revolutionary Italian nationalists seized control of Fiume, a city whose fate was still being decided at the peace negotiations. The old guard of Europe has had to battle with the traditional specter of socialism out of Germany, but also a growing threat ostensibly from the political right. At first labeled \"accelerationism\" by critics, the chaotic blend of political futurism, revolutionary nationalism, and other modernist movements became a badge of identification in Fiume. Now, two years after the fall of France to accelerationism, it appears that history approaches a turning point once more."

news.1.d:0 "The 24 Heures Du Mans is an automobile race that has been held yearly in Le Mans, France since 1923. Although the tradition began before the coup that placed Artaud in power, the Avant-Garde French government has enshrined this tradition as a patriotic display of both modernization and speed, and cherish the opportunity to demonstrate their technological superiority over their rivals, particularly Germany.\nThe stakes at this year's event were particularly captivating, as it marked the first time in the history of Le Mans that two nations with opposing modes of production would compete against one another. Representing the French was the Bugatti corporation, who were given large amounts of investment and support from the Futurist government after swearing loyalty to the Avant-Garde state, as well as benefiting from the corporatist structure of the economy. On the opposite end of the spectrum was the Deutsche Automobilgewerkschaft, a stand-in organization for the Germans, who did not have any corporations with which to participate otherwise. Instead, the German team consisted of hand-selected trade union members alongside their representatives, who were present in order to ensure that the labor involved in preparing for the race met German labor condition standards, despite all proceedings taking place on French soil.\nOther participants included Bentley of the United Kingdom, Alpha Romeo of Italy, and Ford of the United States. The Ford and Alpha Romeo companies were in fierce competition, with the quality-over-quantity philosophy of Alpha Romeo going toe-to-toe with the ingenious productive capabilities of Fordism. Ultimately, Bugatti came in first place, with the German DA coming in a narrow second, with the remaining teams ranking as follows; Alpha Romeo in third, Bentley in fourth, and finally, Ford coming in last place. These results led to German fans accusing the French of cheating, and a violent brawl taking place in the crowd. Eventually the crowd had to be dispersed, and both France and Germany issued official statements of condemnation for the violence that took place."

All across the empire, cities such as Vienna, Prague, and even Laibach have broken out in socialist uproar, and barricades have been constructed from street to street. Violence and counter-violence alike have spread throughout the country, as both imperial forces and German nationalists have begun to brawl with the communist agitators.\n\nThe first victim of the violence was none other than the newly-crowned Kaiser, Karl I. On his way to coronation in Prague, his motorcade was shot at by Czech independence activists with ties to the Austrian left, leaving him wounded. While the severity of his injuries are yet to fully manifest, this has left the Empire, temporarily, without a head, and in this vacuum the realm has begun to tear itself to shreds."

news.3.d:0 "Stability in Central Europe is jostled today as news breaks of the death of the Kaiser Franz Ferdinand I. The reformist monarch had massive shoes to fill upon the death of his uncle Franz Joseph in 1916, as the man was practically an institution himself, and the Great War threatened to shatter the whole of Austria-Hungary. Though the stresses of war and the consequences of trying to quiet Slavic discontent would almost destroy the state, the order in Vienna endured. The core of Austria held back Italian advances long enough to broker a peace with the Entente, and stop revolutionary Germans, Hungarians, and South Slavs from overtaking what remained. \n\nBut now, the Kaiser who practically represented Austria rising from its darkest hour is dead, evidently of a heart attack. There is much speculation on what comes next, given his nephew and heir's public image as an ardent reformer in a similar vein, and the agitation of republicans and socialists against the Hapsburg throne in general."

news.4.d:0 "What started out as a small dispute in the East of the Ottoman Empire has rapidly spiraled out of control. When a Kurdish battalion made an encampment a few kilometers north of the border, they came under fire from Turkish battalions, accusing them of an attempted incursion. Abdülmecid II called for the army to stand down to avoid civil war, but the soldiers marched on, sparking war with Kurdistan as they crossed the Euphrates, and in turn, the Rubicon.\n\nIn the chaos, the incursion spiraled into a revolution within the Anatolian heartland as guerrillas and revolutionaries joined the army with a fervour as strong as it is broad. Communists and Islamic Socialists, Futurists and Anarchists, Romantic Nationalists and Republicans carrying the Kemalist legacy joined with the army as the winds of change lashed the Empire. Despite last minute attempts at compromise, with the Commission evacuating the Strait, Abdülmecid II declared the East to be in open revolt and, raising his standard at Dolmabahçe, called for all loyalists to rally to the Empire's defence.\n\nAs brother takes up arms against brother, the Turkish nation begins to prepare for dark days indeed. Only time will tell now if the flames of revolution will burn down the sick man, or if the forces of reaction will hold back the mountains of change."

news.5.d:0 "Another god in the socialist pantheon has fallen today, as former revolutionary and so-called "liberator" of Budapest, Vladimir Lenin, has died of a stroke. 65 years old, the aging leader of Germany's Communist Party had sustained injuries during his time in Hungary, helping to prop up Béla Kun's regime during the fires of the Great War. It appears that these injuries, thought to be minor, contributed to his ailing health, although his death still came as a shock to many.\n\nOriginally hailing from Russia, Lenin was expelled from his native Social Democratic Party by leader Aleksandr Bogdanov in 1907. From there, he travelled to Switzerland, and in 1918, he served in both the Hungarian and German revolutions, settling in Berlin and serving as Foreign Minister. Yet in 1928, Lenin broke from the German SPD, citing claims of "revisionism," and formed his own party, the Communist Party of Germany. Upon his death, the party will have to select a new leader, for it seems the sands of time wait for nobody, including those larger than life."

Calling themselves the \"Novy Kurs\" , this group includes aristocrats, academics, business magnates and officers, including the former governor of Novorossiya, who has willingly ceded power to Drozdovsky.

Chapayev's new state is seemingly contradictory, for despite the anarchist ideology and structure, he is reveered as a near-saint, and exercizes almost dictatorial rule.

His loyalty to the party has led to what seems to be the beginning of the construction of an unstoppable, fierce political machine by any means necessary. Already, concerns over the sway of party politics in the new administration have been raised, and possible cases of corruption as a way of creating solid bases in civil society have begun to bloom."

For three times has Lerroux held the presidency now, and twice it has been given to him by the people, an exceptional feat in the history of the young democracy.\n\nSeeing the will of the people incarnate in him, Alejandro Lerroux has grown bolder in his boasts and promises. What is to come is a sweeping reform of the Republic so that the rot is extinguished by the wildfire of the PRR, a new Constitution, a new ethos, and a new vision to strive for. A Jacobin, radical, nationalist future in which the Spanish Republic is firmly held aloft by the civic virtue of its compromised citizens, educated to be true sons of the Republic in their hearts as in their minds. Curiously enough, Lerroux has vaguely hinted at more unorthodox policies, such as a \"final solution\" to the religious and regional questions that so plagued his previous government.\n\nWhatever the future may hold for the turbulent Republic, it is absolutely certain it will never outlive nor move away from Alejandro Lerroux's impossibly long shadow."

He has announced that after the first term of reforms Spain is ready to ascend to the next stage: of national revival. What it entails is the most controversial project in the short history of Spanish democracy. The ASR has begun the drafting of a new constitution, one that, according to Ortega, will allow Spain to truly take control over its destiny, and according to his opponents, is the shameless institution of totalitarianism. The position of the President is to be strengthened to near-absolute power, while all other parties are to be forcibly integrated into the newly-formed National Republican Party, which will become the sole legal political organization.\n\nThe followers of the President applaud a new Golden Era awaiting Spain, while the terrified opposition alarms the world of the tragedy that has befallen Spanish democracy. The fears of a crypto-Regenerationist takeover burn stronger than ever, with some leftists prophesying a \"liberal-accelerationist\" dictatorship. "

President de los Rios now eyes his longstanding goal of having the PSOE welcomed back into the Second International - with more than just trepidation. Socialism at home, socialism in the world!\n\nThe PSOE has secured a hegemonic position since the end of the civil war. De los Ríos' brand of humanistic socialism can still thrive in this land, even after the long nightmare of his party playing collaborator to dictators. The project of agrarian reform, though it threatened to reignite civil conflict, has passed its initial teething pains to begin resolving the questions of land in Spain. Coupled with the modernization of Spanish education, it appears the great urban-rural political divide in Spain between reactionary and republican might no longer be as unbreakable as it once was.\n\nBut those smiles of victory are plastered atop a messier reality. The PSOE's machine of patronage and clientelism speaks for itself at this point, being a sword party factions wield to dispense appointments and favors. The game of revolution and war is won, but a new, more subtle but equally vicious game can be played in party politics."

It is expected that they will try to aggressively and haphazardly undo the four past years of the Republic, but who's to say they'll stop there?\n\nMany point out the latent radicalism and resentment from within the PPE, entirely likely to come into surface anytime as the coalition is quickly becoming unstable immediately after their victory. There is a perhaps justified worry that this means a drastic change in the Republic, as the first rightist government in its history has the Sisyphean task to decide whether they will work by the rules of democracy and help it bloom as a multiparty system, or go against it from within to create a project of their own."

Literally carried on the shoulders of workers into parliament, the incoming president has been a stalwart of the Spanish left for decades, staying head of the Workers' General Union even when it split from the PSOE. With the major parties of the Spanish left restrained, Caballero was positioned to unite the unions and syndicates of Spain into a single body. And now, experienced in forming \"dual power\" with Madrid, the Unión de Hermanos Proletarios is ready to renew the Spanish revolution.\n\nWhile critics of Ortega are quick to applaud, Caballero's ascent has placed a great question mark over the Republic itself. Echoing the voice of many of the UHP's constituent unions, he has called for power to pass from the state into the hands of the people.

The PSOE's attempts at agrarian reform have angered the rural oligarchy, who have taken it as a personal attack against their whole caste. On top of this, the increasing secularization of education and public life has prompted a great Catholic reaction in the polls, as the countryside has seen an unprecedented mobilisation of voters across the whole Republic.\n\nThe most traditionalist, atavic, aggressive form of the Spanish right has taken control, and their only goal is to destroy, brick by brick, everything about the current system.

The gap Díaz has left in the Republic will apparently be filled by Andrés Nin Pérez.\n\nThe Catalan firebrand does not just owe his newfound power to striking first, however. President Nin's vision of a rejuvenated communist republic, heralded by a new constitutional convention, was enticing for party militants demanding a demolition of the old institutions. His intention to forge the political scene into a single vanguard party has also been a balm to those who were deeply worried with the developing factionalism under Díaz. Finally, while the right of the PCE protested vigorously, the President's amenability to regional autonomy and concerns was attractive to the party's local groupings. All of this combined to allow the party left to outsmart its opponents, barely avoiding being skinned alive for their impudence.\n\nWith Andrés Nin's victory, it seems the revolution is passing to its youth.

Significant sections of the Persian army have also defected to join the rebelling Socialist and Communist forces, making the situation for the Persian whites even more desperate.\n\nThe civil war started after a massacre of workers by the APOC soldiers in the city of Kerman in response to the assassination of an the APOC official and his wife. This proved to be the straw that shattered the back of the camel. The fury and pent up frustrations of the domination of the APOC and Britain over Iran exploded in a cathartic release of fury as the inhabitants of the city descended on the APOC's soldiers. Following the ensuing bloodbath, the Kerman Commune was declared and multiple other cities followed suit as the floodgates of revolution were torn open by the Persian worker!\n\nAs the front lines start to be drawn and brothers take up arms against each other, the fate of the Jewel of the Orient remains to be seen."

Whilst these news have been met with fury from the Arabic world, the might of Zion, bolstered by hundreds of thousands of immigrant Jews, united in faith.\n\nOutside the grasp of Israel's authority, though, several Muslim populations have been agitating for war to undo the affront to their religion, to the point where thousands of Muslims are already arriving as mercenaries through Egypt and Iraq to attack the Israeli state and its few allies in the world.

With surprising brutality, many important figures were summarily executed by hanging or even stoning. In the wake of the bloodshed, Long, claiming descent from the Emperor Hàm Nghi, was crowned as the new emperor of Indochina.

Though always controversial in the party and Ukraine at large, the discrediting of the OUN's other factions allowed leader Bohdan Antonych to take the helm of the nationalist right.\n\nSince the end of the Mikhnovsky administration, it was expected that Symon Petliura and the USDRP would regain power. Unfortunately for them, evidence of Petliura collaborating with Mikhnovsky and his own acquiescence to Polish economic demands was a bridge too far for the interim government. With a need for a nationalist alternative, the OUN was able to secure enough support to have Antonych named interim president. Despite the party's heritage and its anti-Christian ethos, it appears the new administration is intent on remaining within the Intermarium, but as an equal partner to Poland."

Soon, the strike festered into full blown revolution, and as the days dragged on and the plots against Bogdanov grew, Gastev's favor in the party grew at equal speed.\n\nAt the zenith of fervor, the Council of Soviets was stormed by an angry mob carrying Gastev in on their shoulders. He was quickly sworn in, and already, the flames of revolution have begun to burn chillingly hot. All dissent was squashed with hammer blows and drowned out with factory sirens.

Whether their ideals shall be won through negotiation and freedom of choice, as mandated by their libertarian program, or through bullets and blood, as demanded by the radical Narodnik rhetonic expressed by many within the newly formed government, remains up for question.\n\nUpon being received with a standing ovation by fanatical crowds of followers from within the peasantry, workers' soviets, Spirodonva laid out the goal that had led them all to this moment: a Republic of Labour, free of all who wish to exploit it."

From here, his influence in Russia quickly grew as he established himself as a competent commander of the Red Army. While still subservient to the wider Republican armies, his influence within the Republic only continued to grow. Calling for an alliance of workers, peasants, and soldiers, Trotsky has built a wide base of support among all strata of proletarian.\n\nFor now, the focus of this new government seems to be on extending the revolution to all walks of life and building up a proper revolutionary base, but Trotsky has not been secretive about what he wishes to accomplish.

With great disdain for the aristocracy, bourgeoisie, and urban elite alike, Chapayev championed a model of anarchism that would do away with what he saw as the mindless husk of intellectualism, and in its place forge a People's Commonwealth led by the peasantry as the primary revolutionary force of the working class.\n\nThis new model of Folk Anarchism, while certainly popular with the peasants of Zheltorossiya, has alienated both capitalists and socialists alike. At the same time, smallholders in the countryside and urban bourgeoisie have started fleeing the Republic in droves in fear of a coming wave of mob-led revolutionary terror. With Chapayev holding the reins, it is clear that this new revolution forged by the barrel of a gun is here to stay."

Now, he will be tasked with cleaning up the mess left behind by twenty years of socialist government, handling the aftermath of a failed revolutionary coup, and the perennial task of freeing the west. All these might seem like impossible dreams to an ordinary observer; but to a man like Milyukov who has been in this fight for fifty years, the impossible is a regular occurrence.\n\nDespite seeming like a stodgy conservative, Pavel's life has been one of arrest, exile and revolution.

Alisa Rosenbaum, daughter of a Jewish family which fled east during the revolution, is not like her predecessor. Tired of the wheeling and dealing game of democracy in which the most mediocre always wins, she intends to use the preeminent position of Minister-Chairwoman to reform Zheltorossiya in her image alone.

To their North lies the radicals of the Free Creatorium, and in the West, there are reports of a Honghuzi-led Chinese revolt against the last holdouts of the Zheltorossiyan army lead by Vasily Boldyrev and Konstantin Rodzaevsky's Russian nationalists.

By the time of the enforcement of the 21 demands onto the Beiyang, most international observers assumed that China was merely doomed to live in the shackles of foreign powers.\n\nHowever, following the failure of the Japanese to secure China, a new and unexpected force burst onto the scene. Consisting of unorganised armies of upstart peasants against Beiyang tax collectors and fanatical Millenarians preaching for a return to an idealised Chinese Golden age, the "Yellow Sand Society" was at first thought to be nothing more than a localised and rural insurgency with delusions of grandeur. But following several surprising victories, the Yellow Sand swept across the plains of Northern China, gaining support among the peasantry and various sects of Chinese nationalists who grew disillusioned with the Guomindang. And now, after a gruelling campaign in the rugged valleys and crooked mountains of Southern China, which served as the rock of resistance against so many empires and invaders in the past, the Yellow Sand society has, against seemingly insurmountable odds, triumphed over the petty despots of warlord territories and republican claimants to the Middle Kingdom.\n\nIn an address to the nation from within the Forbidden City in Beijing, Daming declared that the nation of China had finally awoken from three hundred years of slumbering, and now, she would move the world. Promising an end to foreign domination in any corner of China and a return to the ways of the past that made China the centre of the world so long ago has made the Yellow Sands more popular among the people of China, but has drawn concerned looks from across much of the world. But despite whatever the wishes of meddling foreign powers may be, outside of stiff, but small, pockets of resistance in the South, the mandate of Heaven has been claimed yet again, and shows no signs of disappearing soon."

Believing himself to have a part to play in the great revival and reunification of Islam, he preached his teachings to anyone who would listen, amassing a loyal following among the natives. MacBryan's undertaking culminated in the popular seizure of the Astana and the overthrow of the Rajah in favor of him, ending a century of Brooke rule in Sarawak.\n\nSeeming convinced that this new prophet would rule the populace better than the Brookes ever could, Britain accepted the takeover and conceded their remaining protectorates in exchange for his fealty.

The great designs of the Biocosmist Creatorium, who are now boldly aiming to end the tyranny of death, are preparing to be fulfilled."

news.356.desc:0 "Over the last two decades, Zheltorossiya became the shelter for all those exiled from the Empire for their desire for freedom. When the Russian Republic fell, their dreams seemed to come to an end, as violence took over the bastion of freedom against Tsarist reaction. It was in this anarchy that General Vasily Boldyrev, a leading member of the Republican Army, rose up restore what was thought to be lost for good.\n\nTasked with ending the Honghuzi raids in the frontier region with Mongolia, Boldyrev received the news of the collapse of the central authority in Harbin while preparing his troops for the strike against the Chinese bandits. Maintining discipline and order, he proclaimed himself the only legitimate authority of the fallen Republic, bringing to good end his mission before restoring Zheltorossiya.\n\nBut that was not the end for Boldyrev, who next led his men into the battle to finally liberate the Russian homeland from violence and division. At last, the red flag of the revolution flies from Harbin to Petrograd, while Boldyrev can finally dismount from the saddle of the war: the hard times are over, and the time of reconstruction and peace is at last coming to a land that has only known pain and sorrow as far as recent memory goes."

news.357.desc:0 "Ever since the February Revolution, the dream of Russia as a constitutional monarchy envisioned by the likes of Pyotr Stolypin had been believed swept away in favour of social democracy on the left, and a military dictatorship on the right. This assumption was quickly proven as far away from the truth as possible today, as Aleksandr Kolchak, the supreme ruler of Russia, decided to turn his back on the nation's descent into reaction, setting it back on the path it had walked since the reign of Peter the Great.\n\nUnder the newfound leadership of the Party of Peaceful Renovation, the state embarked on a series of reforms both social and economic in hopes of finally dragging Russia into the claws of modernity, whatever the cost. With the power of the Black Hundreds significantly curbed, political parties banned under the Kolchak regime once again were allowed to participate in the democratic process, and much of the economy formerly under state control was privatised.\n\nWith Stolypin's dream of a Western yet sovereign Russia fulfilled, the new regime turns its gaze towards the rest of the world. Already, talks are underway for potential restoration of long begone treaties between the Empire between its old allies in Britain and Königsberg, a sigh of relief for the old order, yet a cause of concern for the new."

When the Russian Republic fell, their dreams seemed to come to an end, as violence took over the Republican bastion. It was in this anarchy that the All-Russian People's Crusade, led by Konstantin Rodzaevsky, took up to arms to restore order and end the Red menace that has been plaguing Russia for decades now.\n\nCutting through all those that opposed them, the Crusade unified the former Russian Republic, then set its sights on all those that stood against the unity and safety of the Russian nation, Red or not. Now, after years of struggle, the lands once covered in brothers' blood are now growing grains and letting flowers bloom. Russia has won its place under the sun, safe from foreign and internal enemies.\n\nThe unity of the church, nation and labour stands triumphant over the Judeo-Bolsheviks, the Republicans and the Futurist demons that tried to chip away Russia for their own taking. The future belongs to those with the will to take it, and it has been by God's blessing that the Crusade and Konstantin Rodzaevsky have had the power and resolve to win and save Russia in its darkest hour."

news.359.desc:0 "The situation in Fiume has been an odd case for most of its existence; a small black spot on the face of Europe which has nonetheless laid the foundation for much of the continent's rising radicalism. While legally a viceroyalty of Italy, d'Annunzio's fiefdom has often acted with impunity, its policy separate and often fully opposed to that of its mother country — a policy that has led it into an alliance with Le Soleil. After d'Annunzio's passing, the nation's independent streak has only grown, energised and emboldened by the French, with it now openly preparing for a revolutionary coup against the government in Rome.\n\nSeeing the looming danger, the Italians have pleaded for assistance from the British. But these pleas have fallen on deaf ears, as prime minister [ENG.GetLeader] has stated plainly: there will be no British intervention in affairs between Italians. Serenity in London, jubilation in Fiume, and grief in Rome; it seems the Kingdom has been thrown to the dogs."

Now, Arab colours fly high in Damascus and Aleppo, mocking the vanquished armies of Ghazi and Sa'adah alike.\n\nAmbassadors from the Second Internationale smile smugly from Damascus as they aid the newborn country in its reconstruction under the eye of "Professor" Zaki al-Arsuzi, intellectual titan of Pan-Arab socialism in the Middle East. His tireless work for the return of Alexandretta to its rightful owners kickstarted a movement greater than himself, a tide of Arabist sentiment that not even the Hashemites could have envisioned. Now, he and his Club of Arabism have lit a flame illuminating the path for an Arab Spring of Nations.\n\nThe United Arab Front has proven its strength by trumping their Syrian rivals, and the future is bright and ambitious for the new Arab State of Shaam. However, nations are not built on dreams, but on policy. Al-Arsuzi and his allies must prove to the word they are ready to leave dissertations behind to become statesmen, or they may be condemned to be just another mirage in the Middle Eastern desert."
