#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
#IDEAS#
LIT_warschauer_vertrag:0 "Der Warschauer Vertrag"
LIT_prophecy:0 "Prophecy from the Valley of Šventaragis"
LIT_prophecy_desc:0 " Despite difficult beginnings, our nation was finally able to regain the statehood it so desperately wanted. This youthful naive enthusiasm brings both risk and many optimistic opportunities. Our democracy is young, but we can work twice as hard to maintain it. But this Lithuanian exceptionalism can bring us problems aswell. Many extremists, including anarchists, communists, neo-pagans, and nationalists take advantage of the sentiments prevailing in our homeland and the instability of our young democracy.\n\nThe turbulent tenure of Antanas Smeton was an example of this. We miraculously escaped the yoke of dictatorship. We overthrew the would-be despot and restored normality. Now, however, many other movements are trying to do what Smetona was unable to do. We should be on our guard and watch our backs carefully."
LIT_thoughts_modern:0 "Thoughts of the Modern Lithuanian"
LIT_thoughts_modern_desc:0 "Thirty years ago, our homeland was thrown at the mercy of Poles by the Tsar's Court. Satan Stolypin and Devil Dmowski tormented our poor homeland together with lice of nations - Jews. Since then, many of our compatriots are not aware of their blood - They speak Polish, think in Russian, and buy from Jews. "Dmowszczyzna" was the biggest blow for us so far.\n\nThe Polish Sword of Damocles hangs over us even to this day. We joined the Intermarium fearing the invasion of Warsaw on our lands while we also wanted some security from Russia, which still wants to take our independence from us. This Pact with the Devil, however, has caused us to be forced to tread carefully in the creation of a modern nation.\n\nBut even inside, Poles and Jews pose a threat to us. We had to limit their legal powers so that they could not dominate us in our own country. They didn't like it. Since then, Our Ultranationalists have come into devastating conflicts with minorities almost daily. They organize reprisals for twenty years of Dmowszczyzna. At the same time, Warsaw looks at our hands with anxious eyes."
