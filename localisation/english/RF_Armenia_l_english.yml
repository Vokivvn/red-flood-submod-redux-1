Yet, there are rumours, whispers of rebellions being plotted in the mountains, funded from Tiflis, that may prove fatal to Armenia's future..."

#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_GAREGIN_DESC:0 "Garegin Nzhdeh is a controversial figure in Armenia, being seen as an extreme ultra-nationalist and violent chauvinist by many of the socialist political estabilishment, and as a national hero by his Tseghakronists, who believe in a strict social hierarchy based on devotion to the Armenian nation. While this is a state secret, his birth name is Garegin Ter-Harutyunyan. Nzdeh was born to a poor family in the village of Kznut, in Nakchivan, born to a family of four of a local priest. Nzhdeh received his education through a Russian school in Nakhchievan City, and then continued his higher education in Georgia. During the Russian Revolution, he fled from Bulgaria and went back to his Armenian homeland, he led militias to liberate Western Armenia from Turkish rule according to the Wilsonian Treaty of Sevrés. Now he sits at the top of the Armenian political world after decades of intrigue, rallies, and denouncings of the socialist Government of Armenia. What future he shall bring to Armenia is up in the air."

Then, the Kavkaz Society, under the guise of aiding Tatar rebels in the name of Transcaucasianism, invaded Armenia and ended their still-fresh independence.\n\nIt would be the Polish victory over the Russian behemoth that led to a restoration of Armenian statehood under Garegin Nzhdeh. Already a local leader before the fall of Armenia to the Russians, he has been able to seize power again, vowing to fulfill what the Dashnaks before were unable to: safeguarding Armenian sovereignty until the end of time.\n\nThe end of the Russian danger can only mean the dawn of a new golden age for Armenia; independence will be protected against anyone who  dares to take away the cherished freedom so many have died for. Let the enemy remember that no matter how hard they try, Armenia is and will always be free."

#### EVENTS
ARM.1.title:0 "Our Ball and Chain"
ARM.1.desc:0 "Armenia sits at a fragile balance after decades of stability as a social-democracy, with an enormous skeleton in it's closet developing from the Dashnak dream of national integrity being finally achieved. Both the former Turkish territories and Karabakh province, having been partially inhabited by Turkic muslims before our arrival, serve as hotbeds of radicals and separatists, something both Constantinople and Baku are utilizing to their hearts content in efforts to undermine us. Nothing in the recent decades came anywhere close to the reports reaching the presidents desc today, however. A group of Azeri bolsheviks, clearly supplied by guns from Kavkaz have raised their banners in rebellion against the state, demanding independence for the so-called Azeri Turk People's Republic. We obviously cannot hear their pleas in full, but many in the government are suggesting we reach out and enter into talks with the separatists. This would help quell the wave of Kavkaz propaganda and help the international community see us in positive light. However, many more nationalist minded representives rose in protest at what they saw as surrendering our principles to the whim of few turkic bolshevist terrorists. Pushing the idea of a peaceful resolution could risk their further radicalisation, something that could prove fatal for our survival. As the Damocles sword clangs over the presidents neck, he decides to...."
ARM.1.a:0 "...Order the rebellion crushed underfoot."
ARM.1.b:0 "...Try entering a peaceful dialogue."
ARM.2.title:0 "A Necessary Evil"
ARM.2.desc:0 "At an emergency meeting of the Hentchak cabinet, one thing is clear: the investment into our armed forces has payed off. Our green clad boys did far more than a great job in crushing the insurgency, ensuring any wishes of the Kavkaz leadership of annexing Karabakh are strangled in their cradle before evil could properly take root. Of course, few incidents (which would normally be considered war crimes were there a tribunal to oversee them) occured, but they were all necessary sacrifices in the struggle for our democracy. If we were less succesful in our endeavor or God forbid tried to talk some sense into these animals, the resulting outcry would be catastrophic for the nascent republic. The ministers pat themselves on the back for a job well done, briefly discuss steps to prevent this from happening again, and go home, seemingly content in life. The Prime Minister, Hovhannes Kajaznuni, while partially sharing the relief of his comrades, is deeply disturbed. Even after he lies down with his wife in the deep dark of the cold Yerevan night, questions tugs incessantly at his mind. "How many more need to die for Armenia to live? What if it was all in vain?" Eventually, he becomes too tired for any worries, and falls into a dreamless slumber."
ARM.2.a:0 "We can only answer to God now."
ARM.3.title:0 "1936 Armenian Elections"
ARM.3.desc:0 "Following the sudden resignation of Kajaznuni and end of the Karabakh crisis, we have decided to create a snap election to see who has the largest support base in our nascent and stable democracy, being either of the biggest parties - the Huntchakians, or the Dashnaks. Who shall win? So exciting!"
ARM.3.a:0 "The Dashnaks win! God bless our Democracy!"
ARM.3.b:0 "The Huntchakian Faction wins! May Armenia prosper as a Socialist nation!"
ARM.4.title:0 "Dashnak Victory!"
ARM.4.desc:0 "After the close call on the Kavkaz border, politics quickly descended into the normal excitement before an election. While the Dashnaks, Huntchakians, and even the Tseghakronists campaigned with a grand fervor, in the end, the people had the final say. When the dust cleared at the polls, the result was for the most part unsurprising: the Armenian Revolutionary Federation has proudly won its majority in parliament. Prime Minister Sirakn Tigranyan gave a stirring speech to the parliament, stressing the importance of social programs, democracy, and the national and ethnic pride of Armenians. Garegin Nzdeh and his acolytes stormed out of the parliament when he began to speak, but his small but fanatical following is not a concern. Mikayel Varandian began to applaud politely after Sirakn finished his oratory, with the rest of the Huntchakians following shortly thereafter, indicating their support for the Dashnak plan. The future of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation appears brighter than ever before."
ARM.4.a:0 "Hooray for the Dashnaks! Hooray for Democracy! Hooray for Armenia!"
ARM.5.title:0 "Huntchakian Victory!"
ARM.5.desc:0 "The elections have consumed the minds of the voters as of late, and they descended to the polls en masse to give their opinion on the state of Armenia. In the end, the result was a surprise, but not a shock: The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party have retained their majority of the seats in parliament, once again beating back the Dashnaks, after a well fought campaign and gaining working class support. The new Prime Minister, Mikayel Varandian, gave a gripping oration to Parliament, stressing the need to protect the working class, defend democracy, and bring about economic and social equality in Armenia. Varandian's predecessor, Sirakn Tigranyan, politely applauded after the conclusion of the address, and the subsequent applause of the rest of the Dashnaks is indicative of their tacit, if uneasy, support of the Hunchakian platform. Garegin Nzdeh and his Tseghakron prostlytes have refused to acknoloege the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party's victory, and have, reportedly, moved into the mountains to live a "pure Armenian lifestyle uncorrupted by German puppet Takanks". His supporters are barely missed, however, and a new day dawns for Armenia."

ARM.6.desc:0 "Panic has spread across the Armenian nation as our attempts at striking a deal with the separatists are not only taken as total surrender to Kavkaz by much of the populance, but end in total fiasco as well. As the photographs taken by the opposition showcasing the colossal failures of both the undertaking and subsequent botched putdowns spread across Armenia like a wildfire, so too does violence and strife. Yerevan has become unrecognizable, as clashes between various paramilitaries scar its avenues. While the assemblagists like the Dashnaks recriminate the blame and pontificate on the total failure of attempts at dialogue ordered by their own government, the Tseghakronists have adopted a far more unified position: The treasonous islamist-bolshevist puppets have entered talks with both Petrograd and Harbin in order to destroy Armenian families. They have swung the Yerevan police to their side, and together they expelled the socialist and other anti-government militias from the city. Then, they marched on the parliament building, finding no real opposition from the government, most of which had long since either fled or disintegrated. Garegin Nzdeh appeared before the National Assembly a triumphant man, demanding that they dissolve immediately and hand over power to him, so that he may root out the traitors, the Bolshevist pawns they are, with force."

ARM.11.desc:0 "Garegin Nzdeh worked tirelessly after his ascension to power. For months, he labored in isolation from the public, leading some to fear (or celebrate) that he had fallen ill, or even had died. At last, however, he was done. *It* was done. He greatest contribution to Armenia, his only love, the state he would without hesitation give his life for and so far already had was done.\n It was not an easy task, creating a list of every prolific Takank in Armenia, but a necessary one. For Armenia to prosper, no, to *survive*, the degenerate subhumans, the *cancer* that were the Takanks needed to be destroyed. And nowhere was the cancer more concentrated than in Yerevan, the blessed heart of Armenia itself. All told, a fourth of the city needed to die. This was doable, however. It was like cleaning a house after decades of neglect, or tending to a garden left fallow for generations, but still doable. Nzdeh and the rest of the Tseghakron gathered up the Takanks and killed them. Men, women, children, all Takanks, all slaughtered. Some were hung from trees and churches, others burned alive, and still others were shot by roaming paramilitaries. Most, however, were rounded up and placed in front of anti-air guns. To say they were killed would be a disservice to the word. They were simply there one moment and, after a deafening roar, gone the next. Yerevan resounded with the sound of choked gasps, screams, weeping, and artillery. Amidst the horrific harmony, a single man began to smile, but stopped himself.\n After all, there were so many *more* that needed to die."

ARM.12.title:0 "Conscript all that are able"
ARM.12.desc:0 "As he observed a line, a thousand people long, of drilling Tsegh soldiers, Garegin Nzdeh felt proud. Why shouldn't he? After all, he has not only ensured the protection of fair and sweet Armenia but guaranteed its growth into the future. As the roar of a thousand rifles echoes throughout the valley, Nzdeh saw something that made him stop in his tracks. An old woman, about 80 or so years old, was struggling to load her rifle and hold it steady. It warmed his heart to see such devotion. Oh, she would die. That much was certain, at least; war is not kind to the weak, the old, and the slow. In fact, Nzdeh doubted she would live past the first few minutes of battle- her heart would give out before she saw combat. But, was that not the greatest sacrifice? To give your life for Mayr Hayastan in glorious and just combat against her many foes? Observing the line again, he assessed the new recruits. By his estimation, only a third would survive the first battle. Deep in his heart, though he would never admit it, he began to envy the doomed.\n After all, martyrdom was the greatest honor one could win, and what cause is greater than that of beautiful Mayr Hayastan?"
ARM.12.a:0 "Truly we have made a place of virtue, a sole paradise on Earth."
