#Leader(s)#
POLITICS_Roman_von_Ungern-Sternberg_DESC:0 "Born in Austria to Baltic-German nobles of the Russian Empire, Nikolai Robert Maximilian von Ungern-Sternberg was a decorated cavalry officer of the Russian Empire, serving his Tsar in the Caucasus during the Great War. When Russia's civil war broke out he joined the White Army in Siberia and quickly made a name for himself, defeating revolutionary forces with his band of brutal, multi-national cavarlymen. The chaos in Russia and deteriorating position of the Republicans in China allowed 'The Mad Baron' to carve out a small kingdom for himself on the Russian-Mongol border region of Tuva, near Lake Baikal. The Baron may have been raised in the Russian Orthodox Church, but his fascination with Chinese-Mongol esoteric Buddhism has lead him to some strange religious beliefs. Combined with his loyalty to a Tsar who does not rule and an Empire that no longer exists, Sternberg now works to complete his dream of a holy counter-revolutionary empire stretching from Petrograd to Canton."

TAN_theocracy:0 "The Most Sacred Republic"
TAN_theocracy_desc:0 "The country of Tuva has been created by the Divine. How else can one explain the turmoil it went through in the last thirty years while escaping death every time? From the collapse of Qing authority, through the area being ruled by Baron von Ungern-Sternberg, subsequent Russian occupation, until today, Tuva has gone through more than one might believe. Yet, as always, it breathes again. The Tuvan people's religion is what kept them alive, and as such, it must be cherished; Baron von Ungern-Sternberg knew this and decided to enlighten himself. As history has it though, he has been called "mad" with all his knowledge cast aside by bureaucrats carrying the will of Russia. For despite the Baron's enlightenment, he was not a native of the land, and could not have known what it really needed. Dunduk Kuular, however, has lived here for the entirety of his life. It is him, who carries the solution. Equality! Enlightenment! Forward, Tuva, go on and prosper!"

mongolia.1.d:0 "Many of the pastoral people of Mongolia would make fine warriors, as their ancestors did. A new campaign to put rifles in the hands of the tribes and encourage a youth cadet system for the orphaned, outcast and delinquent will yield us soldiers in due course."

mongolia.2.d:0 "The so-called Mad Baron of Mongolia has reached out to the buddhist nations of Asia to request all those willing to join his rapturous campaign.

mongolia.3.t:0 "A Day in The Life of a Madman"
mongolia.3.d:0 "Roman von Ungern-Sternberg is quite the opposite of a simple man. As lord and protector of Mongolia, he must balance his involvement in political affairs with the maintenance of his extravagant, yet rugged lifestyle. Today was a day just like any other.\n\nFirstly, the Baron gave the servants in his palace their orders. They were already aware of his rigid schedule, as they are required to be, but nothing gets done in the Baron's palace without his orders. Once the Baron had his first meal of the day, he then started his day with a period of daily meditation and prayer to Buddha, as the spiritual traditions of Mongolia are near and dear to him. As he finished contemplating the Buddha's teachings, the Baron emerged from his meditation room and greeted his wife, Elena Pavlovna. "Is Martha with her instructor?" Asked the Baron. "Yes, they're practicing her usual drills. She seems to be improving. Are you well?" The Baroness looked at the Baron with false enthusiasm. "I am fine, as always, Elena. You should have the servants take you into town this evening."\n\nThe Baroness seemed to respond to this idea, replying, "yes, I think I will do that." Mounting his horse, the Baron then rode off to meet his daughter at the training grounds. The Baron dismounted his horse as he approached Martha, who was just getting done knocking her instructor to the ground. "Look, father!" Martha said, with a spring in her step as she dashed up to the Baron, "I finally knocked him down! I guess this means I'm ready to fight for real now, right?" The Baron looked at Martha with a gleam in his eye. "Absolutely. Toss me his sword." Martha seemed confused. "You heard me," the Baron said, "if you think you're ready, then toss me his sword and take your best shot." Martha followed her father's instructions, and when she charged at him for an attack, he immediately leapt forward and disarmed her. Pointing his sword at her face, the Baron spoke with iron discipline. "When you are ready, you will be able to kill me in less than two seconds without so much as a thought. I will find you a new instructor by morning." The Baron rode away on his horse, knowing fully well that he was the only swordsman in the steppes worthy of teaching his daughter. If he just had some spare time, he thought, he would teach her himself. But no, that would involve leaving part of the Imperial Authority to someone else, and that was worse than death itself. The baron rode on as he continued to consider his responsibilities."
mongolia.3.a:0 "Men who lack strength of mind often have the most strength of will."

mongolia.100.t:0 "The Russian Empire demands the return of its lands!"
