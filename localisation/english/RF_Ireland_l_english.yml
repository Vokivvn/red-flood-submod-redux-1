#LEADER DESCRITIONS#

#IDEAS#
IRE_new_high_king:0 "A New High King"
IRE_new_high_king_desc:0 "\"A time will come, and soon, when there will be a general conviction that no king could exist without a republic and no republic without a king, that both are inseparable as body and soul, that a king without a republic, and a republic without a king, are only words without meaning\"\n-Novalis\n\nWhen Ireland was at her lowest, when all were convinced that her fate would be eternal subservience to the English heel, when none could dream of the republic, one man stood up, and with him the nation followed. Padraig Pearse, first and only president of the republic stands at the center of all politics. Factions come and go, allies may join or leave us, but through it all the father of the republic stays. As long as he remains on this earth and as long as Dublin is free, we shall follow Pearse and he shall lead us to liberty."
IRE_banner_for_all_none:0 "A Banner For All, A Banner For None"
IRE_banner_for_all_none_desc:0 "Sinn Fein, the ruling party of Ireland, is united on one thing and one thing alone: the removal of English rule from Ireland. While this singularity of purpose does help her unify the population, it poses certain issues. Chief among them is that while the party has only one goal, its members do not. Each member has a different vision for what an Ireland without the English will be. Most evidently, we cannot even agree on a permanent banner to fly under leading to the current Irish Republic flag compromise. While the imminent threat of invasion from Belfast holds the party together for now, the constant swaying of the party's policy positions weaken Ireland's image, domestically and abroad."
